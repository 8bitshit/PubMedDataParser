AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in late December 2019 in 
      china and has rapidly spread to many countries around the world. The effective 
      pharmacotherapy can reduce the mortality of COVID-19. Antiviral medications are 
      the candidate therapies for the management of COVID-19. Molnupiravir is an 
      antiviral drug with anti-RNA polymerase activity and currently is under 
      investigation for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. This review focuses on 
      summarizing published literature for the mechanism of action, safety, efficacy, 
      and clinical trials of molnupiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Molnupiravir for Oral Treatment of Covid-19 in Nonhospitalized Patients.
PG  - 509-520

AB  - BACKGROUND: New treatments are needed to reduce the risk of progression of 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Molnupiravir is an oral, small-molecule 
      antiviral prodrug that is active against severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, 
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
      treatment with molnupiravir started within 5 days after the onset of signs or 
      symptoms in nonhospitalized, unvaccinated adults with mild-to-moderate, 
      laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and at least one risk factor for severe Covid-19 
      illness. Participants in the trial were randomly assigned to receive 800 mg of 
      molnupiravir or placebo twice daily for 5 days. The primary efficacy end point 
      was the incidence hospitalization or death at day 29; the incidence of adverse 
      events was the primary safety end point. A planned interim analysis was performed 
      when 50% of 1550 participants (target enrollment) had been followed through day 
      29. RESULTS: A total of 1433 participants underwent randomization; 716 were 
      assigned to receive molnupiravir and 717 to receive placebo. With the exception 
      of an imbalance in sex, baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. 
      The superiority of molnupiravir was demonstrated at the interim analysis; the 
      risk of hospitalization for any cause or death through day 29 was lower with 
      molnupiravir (28 of 385 participants [7.3%]) than with placebo (53 of 377 
      [14.1%]) (difference, -6.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -11.3 
      to -2.4; P = 0.001). In the analysis of all participants who had undergone 
      randomization, the percentage of participants who were hospitalized or died 
      through day 29 was lower in the molnupiravir group than in the placebo group 
      (6.8% [48 of 709] vs. 9.7% [68 of 699]; difference, -3.0 percentage points; 95% 
      CI, -5.9 to -0.1). Results of subgroup analyses were largely consistent with 
      these overall results; in some subgroups, such as patients with evidence of 
      previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, those with low baseline viral load, and those with 
      diabetes, the point estimate for the difference favored placebo. One death was 
      reported in the molnupiravir group and 9 were reported in the placebo group 
      through day 29. Adverse events were reported in 216 of 710 participants (30.4%) 
      in the molnupiravir group and 231 of 701 (33.0%) in the placebo group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with molnupiravir reduced the risk of 
      hospitalization or death in at-risk, unvaccinated adults with Covid-19. (Funded

TI  - Efficacy and safety of three new oral antiviral treatment (molnupiravir, 
      fluvoxamine and Paxlovid) for COVID-19：a meta-analysis.
PG  - 516-523
LID - 10.1080/07853890.2022.2034936 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic has not been completely 
      controlled. Although great achievements have been made in COVID-19 research and 
      many antiviral drugs have shown good therapeutic effects against COVID-19, a 
      simple oral antiviral drug for COVID-19 has not yet been developed. We conducted 
      a meta-analysis to investigate the improvement in mortality or hospitalization 
      rates and adverse events among COVID-19 patients with three new oral antivirals 
      (including molnupiravir, fluvoxamine and Paxlovid). METHODS: We searched 
      scientific and medical databases, such as PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and 
      Cochrane Library for relevant articles and screened the references of retrieved 
      studies on COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of eight studies were included in this 
      study. The drug group included 2440 COVID-19 patients, including 54 patients who 
      died or were hospitalized. The control group included a total of 2348 COVID-19 
      patients, including 118 patients who died or were hospitalized. The overall odds 
      ratio (OR) of mortality or hospitalization was 0.33 (95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 0.22-0.49) for COVID-19 patients in the drug group and placebo group, 
      indicating that oral antiviral drugs were effective for COVID-19 patients and 
      reduced the mortality or hospitalization by approximately 67%. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study showed that three novel oral antivirals (molnupiravir, fluvoxamine and 
      Paxlovid) are effective in reducing the mortality and hospitalization rates in 
      patients with COVID-19. In addition, the three oral drugs did not increase the 
      occurrence of adverse events, thus exhibiting good overall safety. These three 
      oral antiviral drugs are still being studied, and the available data suggest that 
      they will bring new hope for COVID-19 recovery and have the potential to be a 
      breakthrough and very promising treatment for COVID-19.KEY MESSAGESMany antiviral 
      drugs have shown good therapeutic effects, and there is no simple oral antiviral 
      drug for COVID-19 patients.Meta-analysis was conducted for three new oral 
      antivirals to evaluate the improvement in mortality or hospitalization rates and 
      adverse events among COVID-19 patients.We focussed on three new oral Coronavirus 
      agents (molnupiravir, fluvoxamine and Paxlovid) and hope to provide guidance for 
      the roll-out of oral antivirals.

TI  - RdRp inhibitors and COVID-19: Is molnupiravir a good option?

AB  - Rapid changes in the viral genome allow viruses to evade threats posed by the 
      host immune response or antiviral drugs, and can lead to viral persistence in the 
      host cells. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an essential enzyme in RNA 
      viruses, which is involved in RNA synthesis through the formation of 
      phosphodiester bonds. Therefore, in RNA viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2, RdRp 
      could be a crucial therapeutic target. The present review discusses the promising 
      application of RdRp inhibitors, previously approved or currently being tested in 
      human clinical trials, in the treatment of RNA virus infections. Nucleoside 
      inhibitors (NIs) bind to the active site of RdRp, while nonnucleoside inhibitors 
      (NNIs) bind to allosteric sites. Given the absence of highly effective drugs for 
      the treatment of COVID-19, the discovery of an efficient treatment for this 
      pandemic is an urgent concern for researchers around the world. We review the 
      evidence for molnupiravir (MK-4482, EIDD-2801), an antiviral drug originally 
      designed for Alphavirus infections, as a potential preventive and therapeutic 
      agent for the management of COVID-19. At the beginning of this pandemic, 
      molnupiravir was in preclinical development for seasonal influenza. When COVID-19 
      spread dramatically, the timeline for development was accelerated to focus on the 
      treatment of this pandemic. Real time consultation with regulators took place to 
      expedite this program. We summarize the therapeutic potential of RdRp inhibitors, 
      and highlight molnupiravir as a new small molecule drug for COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Molnupiravir and Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir: Oral COVID Antiviral Drugs.

AB  - At a crucial time with rapid spread of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 virus variant globally, 
      the United States Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use 
      authorization for two oral antivirals molnupiravir (>18 years) and 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) (≥12 years; >40kg ) for the outpatient 
      treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 patients who are at risk for progression. 
      Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue, whereas nirmatrelvir is a SARS-CoV-2 main 
      protease inhibitor, and ritonavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor. Drug 
      interactions are a major concern for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. 
      Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir demonstrated a greater risk reduction in hospitalization 
      and death than molnupiravir compared to placebo. Both drugs need to be started 
      within five days of symptoms onset and given for five days duration. This article 
      will review the two oral COVID-19 antiviral drugs including the mechanisms of 
      action, antiviral activity, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, clinical 
      experience including trials, adverse events, recommended indications, and 
      formulary considerations.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) constitutes a major worldwide 
      public health threat and economic burden. The pandemic is still ongoing and the 
      SARS-CoV-2 variants are still emerging constantly, resulting in an urgent demand 
      for new drugs to treat this disease. Molnupiravir, a biological prodrug of NHC 
      (β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine), is a novel nucleoside analogue with a broad-spectrum 
      antiviral activity against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus (MERS-CoV), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 
      bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Ebola virus 
      (EBOV). Molnupiravir showed potent therapeutic and prophylactic activity against 
      multiple coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV in animal 
      models. In clinical trials, molnupiravir showed beneficial effects for mild to 
      moderate COVID-19 patients with a favorable safety profile. The oral 
      bioavailability and potent antiviral activity of molnupiravir highlight its 
      potential utility as a therapeutic candidate against COVID-19. This review 
      presents the research progress of molnupiravir starting with its discovery and 
      synthesis, broad-spectrum antiviral effects, and antiviral mechanism. In 
      addition, the preclinical studies, antiviral resistance, clinical trials, safety, 
      and drug tolerability of molnupiravir are also summarized and discussed, aiming 
      to expand our knowledge on molnupiravir and better deal with the COVID-19 
      epidemic.

AB  - The precocity and efficacy of the vaccines developed so far against COVID-19 has 
      been the most significant and saving advance against the pandemic. The 
      development of vaccines has not prevented, during the whole period of the 
      pandemic, the constant search for therapeutic medicines, both among existing 
      drugs with different indications and in the development of new drugs. The 
      Scientific Committee of the COVID-19 of the Illustrious College of Physicians of 
      Madrid wanted to offer an early, simplified and critical approach to these new 
      drugs, to new developments in immunotherapy and to what has been learned from the 
      immune response modulators already known and which have proven effective against 
      the virus, in order to help understand the current situation.

AB  - There is an urgent need for an effective, oral, direct-acting therapeutic to 
      block transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) and prevent progression to severe coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19). In a phase 2a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 
      multicenter clinical trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and antiviral 
      efficacy of the nucleoside analog molnupiravir in 202 unvaccinated participants 
      with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptom duration <7 days. Participants 
      were randomized 1:1 to receive molnupiravir (200 mg) or placebo and then 3:1 to 
      receive molnupiravir (400 or 800 mg) or placebo, orally twice daily for 5 days. 
      Antiviral activity was assessed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs. Infectious virus 
      was assessed by inoculation of cultured Vero cells with samples from 
      nasopharyngeal swabs and was detected by RT-PCR. Time to viral RNA clearance 
      (primary endpoint) was decreased in the 800-mg molnupiravir group (median 14 
      days) compared to the placebo group (median 15 days) (log rank P value = 0.013). 
      Of participants receiving 800 mg of molnupiravir, 92.5% achieved viral RNA 
      clearance compared with 80.3% of placebo recipients by study end (4 weeks). 
      Infectious virus (secondary endpoint) was detected in swabs from 1.9% of the 
      800-mg molnupiravir group compared with 16.7% of the placebo group at day 3 of 
      treatment (P = 0.016). At day 5 of treatment, infectious virus was not isolated 
      from any participants receiving 400 or 800 mg of molnupiravir compared with 11.1% 
      of placebo recipients (P = 0.034 and 0.027, respectively). Molnupiravir was well 
      tolerated across all doses.

TI  - Antiviral activity of molnupiravir against COVID-19: a schematic review of 
      evidences.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The study was aimed at encapsulating the evidence of in vitro and in 
      vivo antiviral activities of molnupiravir and its active form against highly 
      pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen responsible for COVID-19, and finding out the 
      efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in clinical trials. MAIN BODY: Information on 
      publications was explored on several databases, gray literature was reviewed, and 
      the outcomes were discussed narratively. Molnupiravir's antiviral efficacy and 
      associated mechanism of action have been verified in vitro against both non-COVID 
      and multiple coronaviruses. Molnupiravir has been tried in preclinical 
      investigations in numerous animal models against non-coronaviruses. Clinical 
      studies in several countries are now being conducted to evaluate its antiviral 
      efficacy in persons infected with COVID-19. The medication displays antiviral 
      effect via generation of copying mistakes during viral RNA replication. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Molnupiravir is the first oral antiviral medicine to show 
      considerable and convincing antiviral activity in vitro and in animal models. 
      Molnupiravir stops the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in animals that have been infected 
      and in cells grown in a lab. In a clinical research, early molnupiravir treatment 
      reduced hospitalization and death risk in unvaccinated individuals with COVID-19. 
      In the battle against SARS-CoV-2, it could be a potent weapon. However, its role 
      in COVID-19 in moderate to severe cases is still up in the air, and more research 
      is needed.

AB  - Despite the progress in the management of COVID-19, effective oral antiviral 
      agents are still lacking. In the present review, the potential beneficial effects 
      of molnupiravir in the management of COVID-19 are discussed. A literature search 
      in Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov for the relevant 
      articles regarding the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical trials of 
      molnupiravir in the management of COVID-19 is conducted. Most of the preclinical 
      studies and available clinical trials showed a favorable short-term safety 
      profile of molnupiravir; however, given its possible genotoxic effects, further 
      trials are required to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of molnupiravir 
      in patients with COVID-19.

TI  - An updated practical guideline on use of molnupiravir and comparison with agents 
      having emergency use authorization for treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Molnupiravir is a newer oral antiviral drug that has 
      recently received emergency use authorization (EUA) in USA, UK and India. We aim 
      to conduct an update on our previous systematic review to provide practical 
      clinical guideline for using molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We 
      systematically searched the electronic database of PubMed, MedRxiv and Google 
      Scholar until January 5, 2022, using key MeSH keywords. RESULTS: Final result of 
      phase 3 study in 1433 non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed a significant 
      reduction in composite risk of hospital admission or death (absolute risk 
      difference, -3.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, -5.9 to -0.1%]; 1-sided 
      P = 0.02) although with a non-significant 31% relative risk reduction (RRR). RRR 
      for death alone was 89% (95% CI, 14 to 99; P-value not reported). Number needed 
      to treat to prevent 1 death or 1 hospitalization or death composite appears to be 
      closely competitive to other agents having EUA in people with COVID-19. However, 
      cost-wise molnupiravir is comparatively cheaper compared to all other agents. 
      CONCLUSION: Molnupiravir could be a useful agent in non-pregnant unvaccinated 
      adults with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of severity including 
      hospitalization. However, it is effective only when used within 5-days of onset 
      of symptoms. A 5-days course seems to be safe without any obvious short-term side 
      effects.

AB  - Molnupiravir (Lagevrio(®)) is an orally-administered antiviral prodrug that 
      inhibits replication of RNA viruses through viral error induction. It is being 
      developed by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics for the prevention and treatment 
      of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Molnupiravir received its first approval 
      on 4 November 2021 in the UK for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in 
      adults with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostic test and who have at least one risk factor for developing 
      severe illness. Molnupiravir is filed for approval and has emergency use 
      authorization for the treatment of COVID-19 in several countries, including the 
      USA, Japan and those in the EU. This article summarizes the milestones in the 
      development of molnupiravir leading to this first approval for COVID-19.

TI  - Antiviral Efficacy of Molnupiravir for COVID-19 Treatment.
LID - 10.3390/v14040763 [doi]
LID - 763
AB  - The ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19 poses unprecedented public health risks 
      for governments and societies around the world, which have been exacerbated by 
      the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Pharmaceutical interventions with high 
      antiviral efficacy are expected to delay and contain the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      Molnupiravir, as an oral antiviral prodrug, is active against SARS-CoV-2 and is 
      now (23 February 2022) one of the seven widely-used coronavirus treatments. To 
      estimate its antiviral efficacy of Molnupiravir, we built a granular mathematical 
      within-host model. We find that the antiviral efficacy of Molnupiravir to stop 
      the growth of the virus is 0.56 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.64), which could inhibit 56% of 
      the replication of infected cells per day. There has been good progress in 
      developing high-efficacy antiviral drugs that rapidly reduce viral load and may 
      also reduce the infectiousness of treated cases if administered as early as 
      possible.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, various drug candidates have been developed, 
      molnupiravir (MK-4482 and EIDD-2801), which is a new orally anti-viral agent 
      under development for the treatment of COVID-19, is under study in the final 
      stage of the clinical trial. Molnupiravir enhances the replication of viral RNA 
      mutations in animals and humans. Due to the high demand for the synthesis of this 
      drug, it was essential to develop an efficient and suitable synthetic pathway 
      from raw material. In this study, molecular docking analysis on molnupiravir is 
      examined also, the mechanism of action (MOA) and the recent synthetic pathway is 
      reported. This review will be helpful to different disciplines such as medicinal 
      chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and pharmacology.

AB  - We assessed the in vitro antiviral activity of remdesivir and its parent 
      nucleoside GS-441524, molnupiravir and its parent nucleoside EIDD-1931 and the 
      viral protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir against the ancestral SARS-CoV2 strain and 
      the five variants of concern including Omicron. VeroE6-GFP cells were pre-treated 
      overnight with serial dilutions of the compounds before infection. The GFP signal 
      was determined by high-content imaging on day 4 post-infection. All molecules 
      have equipotent antiviral activity against the ancestral virus and the VOCs 
      Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. These findings are in line with the 
      observation that the target proteins of these antivirals (respectively the viral 
      RNA dependent RNA polymerase and the viral main protease Mpro) are highly 
      conserved.

TI  - Editorial: Current Status of Oral Antiviral Drug Treatments for SARS-CoV-2 
      Infection in Non-Hospitalized Patients.
PG  - e935952
LID - 10.12659/MSM.935952 [doi]
AB  - On 4th November 2021, the first oral antiviral drug for COVID-19, molnupiravir 
      (Lagevrio®), received full regulatory approval from the Medicines and Healthcare 
      Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK. Molnupiravir is an orally 
      bioavailable antiviral drug for use at home when a SARS-CoV-2 test is positive. 
      On 22nd December 2022, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the 
      oral antiviral drug, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) for adults and children 
      with mild and moderate COVID-19 at increased risk of progression to severe 
      COVID-19. These regulatory drug approvals come at a crucial time when new 
      variants of concern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are spreading rapidly. Although the 
      FDA approved remdesivir (Veklury®) on 22nd October 2020 for use in adults and 
      children for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, its use has 
      been limited by the requirement for intravenous administration in a healthcare 
      facility. The four FDA-approved therapeutic neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, 
      imdevimab, bamlanivimab, etesevimab, and casirivimab are costly and also require 
      medically-supervised intravenous administration. The availability of effective, 
      low-cost oral antiviral drugs available in a community setting that can be used 
      at an early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection is now a priority in controlling 
      COVID-19. An increasing number of repurposed antiviral drugs are currently under 
      investigation or in the early stages of regulatory approval. This Editorial aims 
      to present an update on the current status of orally bioavailable antiviral drug 
      treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      variants1,2. While the original Omicron lineage, BA.1, has become dominant in 
      many countries, BA.2 has been detected in at least 67 countries and has become 
      dominant in the Philippines, India, and Denmark. Here, we evaluated the 
      replicative ability and pathogenicity of an authentic infectious BA.2 isolate in 
      immunocompetent and human ACE2 (hACE2)-expressing mice and hamsters. In contrast 
      to recent data with chimeric, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 strains expressing the spike 
      proteins of BA.1 and BA.2 on an ancestral WK-521 backbone3, we observed similar 
      infectivity and pathogenicity in mice and hamsters between BA.2 and BA.1, and 
      less pathogenicity compared to early SARS-CoV-2 strains. We also observed a 
      marked and significant reduction in the neutralizing activity of plasma from 
      COVID-19 convalescent individuals and vaccine recipients against BA.2 compared to 
      ancestral and Delta variant strains. In addition, we found that some therapeutic 
      monoclonal antibodies (REGN10987/REGN10933, COV2-2196/COV2-2130, and S309) and 
      antiviral drugs (molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir, and S-217622) can restrict viral 
      infection in the respiratory organs of hamsters infected with BA.2. These 
      findings suggest that the replication and pathogenicity of BA.2 is comparable to 
      that of BA.1 in rodents and that several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and 
      antiviral compounds are effective against Omicron/BA.2 variants.

TI  - Molnupiravir, favipiravir and other antiviral drugs with proposed potentials for 
      management of COVID-19: a concern on antioxidant aspect.
PG  - 1-4
AB  - COVID-19 is an important global public health problem that causes millions of 
      infections worldwide. The specific antiviral drug for this new infection is still 
      under research. Some new antiviral drugs, including molnupiravir and favipiravir, 
      are proposed for usefulness in management of COVID-19. Additionally, some classic 
      antiviral drugs used for other viral infections are also reproposed for the 
      potentials for management of COVID-19. In the management of COVID-19, there are 
      several pharmacological actions. An important consideration in antiviral therapy 
      is the management of oxidative stress, which plays important roles in viral 
      infections including to COVID-19. The analysis of antioxidative properties of 
      alternative drugs for management of COVID-19 is interesting and can give basic 
      data for further new antiviral drug researching. Here, the authors perform a 
      molecular analysis on molnupiravir, favipiravir and other antiviral drugs with 
      proposed potentials for management of COVID-19 to determine their antioxidative 
      properties. Data from electron acceptor and donor calculation for each drug is 
      used for further estimating overall antioxidative characteristic. Based on the 
      present study, all studied drugs have overall antioxidative properties. Hence, 
      the advantage of molnupiravir, favipiravir and other antiviral drugs with 
      proposed potentials for the management of COVID-19 is their direct action on 
      viral molecule via binding-blocking process as well as antixodiative process. For 
      management of COVID-19 antioxidative stress, other non-antiviral drugs that are 
      proposed for clinical advantage might also be useful.

TI  - The pill of recovery; Molnupiravir for treatment of COVID-19 patients; a 
      systematic review.
LID - 10.1016/j.jsps.2022.03.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Throughout the time of the global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus, there 
      has been a compelling necessity for the development of effective antiviral agents 
      and prophylactic vaccines to limit the virus spread, disease burden, 
      hospitalization, and mortality. Until mid of 2021, the NIH treatment guideline 
      declared no single oral therapy proven to treat mild to moderate cases. A new 
      hope arose when a repurposed direct acting oral anti-viral agent "Molnupiravir" 
      was shown to be effective in decreasing mortality and need for hospitalization in 
      mild to moderate cases with relatively good safety profile; exhibiting a 
      significant reduction in virus titers only after two days from administration. 
      Molnupiravir recently granted the FDA emergency use authorization to treat mild 
      to moderate COVID-19 patients with at least one risk factor for progression. 
      METHODS: We performed a computer-based literature search of (PubMed, Science 
      direct, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, Cochrane COVID study 
      register, EU registry, Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI)) till February 
      15(th), 2022. The following keywords were used in our search ("Molnupiravir " or 
      "NHC" or "EIDD-2807" or "MK-4482" or "EIDD-1931"). RESULTS: We identified from 
      the initial search a total of 279 articles; 246 articles (BioRxiv and MedRxiv 
      N=186, PubMed N=33, Science direct N=27) and 33 Clinical trials from the 
      following registries (ISCTRN (N=1), Clinical trials.gov (N=6), CTRI (N=12), 
      Cochrane (N=14)).Through screening phases, 21 records were removed as duplicates 
      and 198 irrelevant records were also excluded. The included studies in this 
      systematic review were (N=60) included 39 published papers and 21 clinical 
      trials. After Manual addition (N=4), the qualitative assessment included (N=64). 
      CONCLUSION: Based on the cumulative evidence from preclinical and clinical 
      studies, Molnupiravir is proven to be well tolerated, direct acting oral 
      anti-viral agent to halt the disease progression in mild to moderate COVID-19 
      cases; in terms of mortality and hospitalization rates.

AB  - In this work, we report in-depth computational studies of three plausible 
      tautomeric forms, generated through the migration of two acidic protons of the 
      N(4)-hydroxylcytosine fragment, of molnupiravir, which is emerging as an 
      efficient drug to treat COVID-19. The DFT calculations were performed to verify 
      the structure of these tautomers, as well as their electronic and optical 
      properties. Molecular docking was applied to examine the influence of the 
      structures of the keto-oxime, keto-hydroxylamine and hydroxyl-oxime tautomers on 
      a series of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These tautomers exhibited the best affinity 
      behavior (-9.90, -7.90, and -9.30 kcal/mol, respectively) towards RdRp-RTR and 
      Nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3_range 207-379-MES).

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern type and biological sex affect efficacy of 
      molnupiravir in dwarf hamster model of severe COVID-19.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) have triggered distinct infection waves in 
      the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, culminating in currently 
      all-time high incidence rates of VOC omicron. Orally available direct-acting 
      antivirals such as molnupiravir promise to improve disease management and limit 
      SARS-CoV-2 spread. However, molnupiravir efficacy against VOC delta was 
      questioned based on clinical trial results and its potency against omicron is 
      unknown. This study evaluates molnupiravir against a panel of relevant VOC in 
      three efficacy models: primary human airway epithelium organoids, the ferret 
      model of upper respiratory disease, and a lethal Roborovski dwarf hamster 
      efficacy model of severe COVID-19-like acute lung injury. All VOC were equally 
      efficiently inhibited by molnupiravir in cultured cells and organoids. Treatment 
      consistently reduced upper respiratory VOC shedding in ferrets and prevented 
      viral transmission. Pathogenicity in the dwarf hamsters was VOC-dependent and 
      highest for gamma, omicron, and delta with fulminant lung histopathology. Oral 
      molnupiravir started 12 hours after infection resulted in complete survival of 
      treated dwarf hamsters independent of challenge VOC. However, reduction in lung 
      virus differed VOC-dependently, ranging from one (delta) to four (gamma) orders 
      of magnitude compared to vehicle-treated animals. Dwarf hamsters infected with 
      VOC omicron showed significant individual variation in response to treatment. 
      Virus load reduction was significant in treated males, but not females. The dwarf 
      hamster model recapitulates mixed efficacy of molnupiravir seen in human trials 
      and alerts that therapeutic benefit of approved antivirals must be continuously 
      reassessed in vivo as new VOC emerge.

PG  - 706-714

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant emerged in 2021(1) and has multiple mutations 
      in its spike protein(2). Here we show that the spike protein of Omicron has a 
      higher affinity for ACE2 compared with Delta, and a marked change in its 
      antigenicity increases Omicron's evasion of therapeutic monoclonal and 
      vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralizing antibodies after two doses. mRNA 
      vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and broadens neutralization. 
      Importantly, the antiviral drugs remdesivir and molnupiravir retain efficacy 
      against Omicron BA.1. Replication was similar for Omicron and Delta virus 
      isolates in human nasal epithelial cultures. However, in lung cells and gut 
      cells, Omicron demonstrated lower replication. Omicron spike protein was less 
      efficiently cleaved compared with Delta. The differences in replication were 
      mapped to the entry efficiency of the virus on the basis of 
      spike-pseudotyped virus assays. The defect in entry of Omicron pseudotyped virus 
      to specific cell types effectively correlated with higher cellular RNA expression 
      of TMPRSS2, and deletion of TMPRSS2 affected Delta entry to a greater extent than 
      Omicron. Furthermore, drug inhibitors targeting specific entry pathways(3) 
      demonstrated that the Omicron spike inefficiently uses the cellular protease 
      TMPRSS2, which promotes cell entry through plasma membrane fusion, with greater 
      dependency on cell entry through the endocytic pathway. Consistent with 
      suboptimal S1/S2 cleavage and inability to use TMPRSS2, syncytium formation by 
      the Omicron spike was substantially impaired compared with the Delta spike. The 
      less efficient spike cleavage of Omicron at S1/S2 is associated with a shift in 
      cellular tropism away from TMPRSS2-expressing cells, with implications for 
      altered pathogenesis.

TI  - Molnupiravir: A lethal mutagenic drug against rapidly mutating severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-A narrative review.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.27730 [doi]
AB  - Broad-spectrum antiviral agents targeting viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
      (RdRp) are expected to be a key therapeutic strategy in the ongoing coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its future variants of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. 
      Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analog that in vivo experiments have been reported 
      to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. 
      Clinical trials of molnupiravir as a therapy for patients with mild-to-moderate 
      COVID-19 also suggest its significant therapeutic efficacy in comparison to 
      placebo. Molnupiravir is lethally mutagenic against viral RNA, but its effect on 
      host cell DNA is being questioned. Herein, the safety concerns of molnupiravir 
      are discussed with recent findings from published reports and clinical trials. 
      The unchanged efficacy of molnupiravir against mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants is 
      also highlighted. With its administration via the oral route, molnupiravir is 
      expected to turn the tide of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had grounded the world to a 
      standstill. As the disease continues to rage two years on, it is apparent that 
      effective therapeutics are critical for a successful endemic living with 
      COVID-19. A dearth in suitable antivirals has prompted researchers and healthcare 
      professionals to investigate existing and developmental drugs against severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although some of these 
      drugs initially appeared to be promising for the treatment of COVID-19, they were 
      ultimately found to be ineffective. In this review, we provide a retrospective 
      analysis on the merits and limitations of some of these drugs that were tested 
      against SARS-CoV-2 as well as those used for adjuvant therapy. While many of 
      these drugs are no longer part of our arsenal for the treatment of COVID-19, 
      important lessons can be learnt. The recent inclusion of molnupiravir and 
      Paxlovid™ as treatment options for COVID-19 represent our best hope to date for 
      endemic living with COVID-19. Our viewpoints on these two drugs and their 
      prospects as current and future antiviral agents will also be provided.

AB  - Molnupiravir is an orally active nucleoside analog antiviral drug that recently 
      was approved by the U.S. FDA for emergency treatment of adult patients infected 
      with the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus and at risk for severe progression. The 
      active form of the drug, N-hydroxycytidine (NHC) triphosphate competes for 
      incorporation by RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) into the replicating viral 
      genome resulting in mutations and arrest of the replicating virus. Historically, 
      some nucleoside analog antiviral drugs have been found to lack specificity for 
      the virus and also inhibit replication and/or expression of the mitochondrial 
      genome. The objective of the present study was to test whether molnupiravir 
      and/or NHC also target mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (PolG) or RNA 
      polymerase (POLRMT) activity to inhibit the replication and/or expression of the 
      mitochondrial genome leading to impaired mitochondrial function. Human-derived 
      HepG2 cells were exposed for 48 h in culture to increasing concentrations of 
      either molnupiravir or NHC after which cytotoxicity, mtDNA copy number and 
      mitochondrial gene expression were determined. The phenotypic endpoint, 
      mitochondrial respiration, was measured with the Seahorse® XF96 Extracellular 
      Flux Analyzer. Both molnupiravir and NHC were cytotoxic at concentrations of 
      ≥10 μM. However, at non-cytotoxic concentrations, neither significantly altered 
      mitochondrial gene dose or transcription, or mitochondrial respiration. From this 
      we conclude that mitochondrial toxicity is not a primary off target in the 
      mechanism of cytotoxicity for either molnupiravir or its active metabolite NHC in 
      the HepG2 cell line.

AB  - Nucleoside analogues are reagents that resemble the structure of natural 
      nucleosides and are widely applied in antiviral and anticancer therapy. 
      Molnupiravir, a recently reported nucleoside analogue drug, has shown its 
      inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2. Rapid tracing of molnupiravir and its 
      metabolites is important in the evaluation of its pharmacology effect, but direct 
      sensing of molnupiravir as a single molecule has not been reported to date. Here, 
      we demonstrate a nanopore-based sensor with which direct sensing of molnupiravir 
      and its two major metabolites β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine and its triphosphate can be 
      achieved simultaneously. In conjunction with a custom machine learning algorithm, 
      an accuracy of 92% was achieved. This sensing strategy may be useful in the 
      current pandemic and is in principle suitable for other nucleoside analogue 
      drugs.

AB  - Antiviral drugs have gained much more attention in recent years due to severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and many drug 
      candidates are currently under investigation in order to end pandemic. 
      Molnupiravir, a prodrug of the synthetic nucleoside derivative 
      N4-hydroxycytidine, is one of the promising candidates for SARS-CoV-2 treatment. 
      In this study, a RP-HPLC method was developed for the determination of 
      Molnupiravir and applied for in vitro permeability studies of self-emulsifying 
      drug delivery system (SEDDS) formulations using Caco-2 cell line. Discovery® HS 
      C18 Column (75 ×4.6 mm, 3 µm) was used at 30 °C. Isocratic elution was performed 
      with ACN:water (20:80 v/v) mixture. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min and UV detection 
      was at 240 nm. Molnupiravir eluted within 5 min. Molnupiravir was exposed to 
      thermal, photolytic, hydrolytic, and oxidative stress conditions. Peak 
      homogeneity data of Molnupiravir in the stressed samples peak obtained using 
      photodiode array detector, in the stressed sample chromatograms, demonstrated the 
      specificity of the method for their estimation in presence of degradants. The 
      developed method was validated according to the International Council for 
      Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines and found to be linear within the range 
      0.1-60.0 μg/mL. The method was simple, rapid, selective, sensitive, accurate, 
      precise, robust and rugged. Thus, it was applied successfully for permeability 
      quantitation of Molnupiravir in nanoformulations. The apparent permeability of 
      Molnupiravir in SEDDS formulations, which have droplet size under 350 nm, was 
      calculated as 3.20 ± 0.44 × 10(-6) cm/s.

LID - 10.1021/jacs.1c11048 [doi]
AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need for cost-effective processes to 
      rapidly manufacture antiviral drugs at scale. Here we report a concise 
      biocatalytic process for Molnupiravir, a nucleoside analogue recently approved as 
      an orally available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Key to the success of this process 
      was the development of an efficient biocatalyst for the production of 
      N-hydroxy-cytidine through evolutionary adaption of the hydrolytic enzyme 
      cytidine deaminase. This engineered biocatalyst performs >85 000 turnovers in 
      less than 3 h, operates at 180 g/L substrate loading, and benefits from in situ 
      crystallization of the N-hydroxy-cytidine product (85% yield), which can be 
      converted to Molnupiravir by a selective 5'-acylation using Novozym 435.

TI  - Outpatient Therapies for COVID-19: How Do We Choose?
PG  - ofac008
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofac008 [doi]
LID - ofac008
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several outpatient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapies have 
      reduced hospitalization in randomized controlled trials. The choice of therapy 
      may depend on drug efficacy, toxicity, pricing, availability, and available 
      infrastructure. To facilitate comparative decision-making, we evaluated the 
      efficacy of each treatment in clinical trials and estimated the cost per 
      hospitalization prevented. METHODS: Wherever possible, we obtained relative risk 
      for hospitalization from published randomized controlled trials. Otherwise, we 
      extracted data from press releases, conference abstracts, government submissions, 
      or preprints. If there was >1 study, the results were meta-analyzed. Using 
      relative risk, we estimated the number needed to treat (NNT), assuming a baseline 
      hospitalization risk of 5%, and compared the cost per hospitalization prevented 
      with the estimate for an average Medicare COVID-19 hospitalization ($21 752). 
      Drug pricing was estimated from GoodRx, from government purchases, or 
      manufacturer estimates. Administrative and societal costs were not included. 
      Results will be updated online as new studies emerge and/or final numbers become 
      available. RESULTS: At a 5% risk of hospitalization, the estimated NNT was 80 for 
      fluvoxamine, 91 for colchicine, 72 for inhaled corticosteroids, 24 for 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, 50 for molnupiravir, 28 for remdesivir, 25 for 
      sotrovimab, 29 for casirivimab/imdevimab, and 29 for bamlanivimab/etesevimab. For 
      drug cost per hospitalization prevented, colchicine, fluvoxamine, inhaled 
      corticosteroids, and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were below the Medicare estimated 
      hospitalization cost. CONCLUSIONS: Many countries are fortunate to have access to 
      several effective outpatient therapies to prevent COVID-19 hospitalization. Given 
      differences in efficacy, toxicity, cost, and administration complexity, this 
      assessment serves as one means to frame treatment selection.

TI  - Molnupiravir (MK-4482) is efficacious against Omicron and other SARS-CoV-2 
      variants in the Syrian hamster COVID-19 model.

AB  - The recent emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant of concern (VOC) 
      containing a heavily mutated spike protein capable of escaping preexisting 
      immunity, identifies a continued need for interventional measures. Molnupiravir 
      (MK-4482), an orally administered nucleoside analog, has demonstrated efficacy 
      against earlier SARS-CoV-2 lineages and was recently approved for SARS-CoV-2 
      infections in high-risk adults. Here we assessed the efficacy of MK-4482 against 
      the earlier Alpha, Beta and Delta VOCs and Omicron in the Syrian hamster COVID-19 
      model. Omicron replication and associated lung disease in vehicle treated 
      hamsters was reduced compared to the earlier VOCs. MK-4482 treatment inhibited 
      virus replication in the lungs of Alpha, Beta and Delta VOC infected hamsters. 
      Importantly, MK-4482 profoundly inhibited virus replication in the upper and 
      lower respiratory tract of hamsters infected with the Omicron VOC. Consistent 
      with its mutagenic mechanism, MK-4482 treatment had a more pronounced inhibitory 
      effect on infectious virus titers compared to viral RNA genome load. 
      Histopathologic analysis showed that MK-4482 treatment caused a concomitant 
      reduction in the level of lung disease and viral antigen load in infected 
      hamsters across all VOCs examined. Together, our data indicate the potential of 
      MK-4482 as an effective antiviral against known SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, especially 
      Omicron, and likely future SARS-CoV-2 variants. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY: MK-4482 
      inhibits replication of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including 
      Omicron, in the Syrian hamster COVID-19 model.

TI  - Oral antivirals for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
PG  - 41-49
LID - 10.24875/AIDSRev.22000001 [doi]
AB  - Vaccines and antivirals are the classical weapons deployed to contain, prevent, 
      and treat life-threatening viral illnesses. Specifically, for SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, vaccines protect against severe COVID-19 disease manifestations and 
      complications. However, waning immunity and emergence of vaccine escape mutants 
      remains a growing threat. This is highlighted by the current surge of the omicron 
      COVID-19 variant. Thus, there is a race to find treatment alternatives. We 
      contend that oral small molecule antivirals that halt SARSCoV- 2 infection are 
      essential. Compared to currently available monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir, 
      where parenteral administration is required, oral antivirals offer treatments in 
      an outpatient setting with dissemination available on a larger scale. In response 
      to this need at 2021's end, regulatory agencies provided emergency use 
      authorization for both molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir. These medicines act on the 
      viral polymerase and protease, respectively. Each is given for 5 days and can 
      reduce disease progression by 30% and 89%, respectively. The advent of additional 
      oral antivirals, the assessment of combination therapies, the formulation of 
      extended-release medications, and their benefit for both early treatment and 
      prophylaxis will likely transform the landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Orally delivered drugs offer significant benefits in the fight against viral 
      infections, and cost-effective production is critical to their impact on pandemic 
      response in low- and middle-income countries. One example, molnupiravir, a 
      COVID-19 therapy developed by Emory, Ridgeback, and Merck & Co., had potential to 
      benefit from significant cost of goods (COGs) reductions for its active 
      pharmaceutical ingredient (API), including starting materials. A holistic 
      approach to identifying, developing, and evaluating optimized synthetic routes, 
      which includes detailed COGs modeling, provides a rapid means to increase the 
      availability, uptake and application of molnupiravir and other antivirals in 
      global markets. Identification and development of alternate processes for the 
      synthesis of molnupiravir has been conducted by the Medicines for All Institute 
      at Virginia Commonwealth University (M4ALL) and the Green and Turner Labs at the 
      University of Manchester. Both groups developed innovative processes based on 
      synthetic route design and biocatalysis aimed at lowering costs and improving 
      global access. The authors then performed COGs modeling to assess cost saving 
      opportunities. This included a focus on manufacturing environments and facilities 
      amenable to global public health and the identification of key parameters using 
      sensitivity analyses. While all of the evaluated routes provide efficiency 
      benefits, the best options yielded 3-6 fold API COGs reductions leading to 
      treatment COGs as low as <$3/regimen. Additionally, key starting materials and 
      cost drivers were quantified to evaluate the robustness of the savings. Finally, 
      COGs models can continue to inform the focus of future development efforts on the 
      most promising routes for additional cost savings. While the full price of a 
      treatment course includes other factors, these alternative API synthetic 
      approaches have significant potential to help facilitate broader access in low- 
      and middle-income countries. As other promising therapeutics are developed, a 
      similar process could enable rapid cost reductions while enhancing global access.

TI  - Can Panax ginseng help control cytokine storm in COVID-19?
LID - 10.1016/j.jgr.2022.02.006 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently a pandemic caused by severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 are directly 
      associated with hyper-activation of innate immune response that excessively 
      produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce cytokine storm, leading to 
      multi-organ-failure and significant morbidity/mortality. Currently, several 
      antiviral drugs such as Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir) and molnupiravir 
      are authorized to treat mild to moderate COVID-19, however, there are still no 
      drugs that can specifically fight against challenges of SARS-CoV-2 variants. 
      Panax ginseng, a medicinal plant widely used for treating various conditions, 
      might be appropriate for this need due to its anti-inflammatory/cytokine/viral 
      activities, fewer side effects, and cost efficiency. To review Panax ginseng and 
      its pharmacologically active-ingredients as potential phytopharmaceuticals for 
      treating cytokine storm of COVID-19, articles that reporting its positive effects 
      on the cytokine production were searched from academic databases. 
      Experimental/clinical evidences for the effectiveness of Panax ginseng and its 
      active-ingredients in preventing or mitigating cytokine storm, especially for the 
      cascade of cytokine storm, suggest that they might be beneficial as an adjunct 
      treatment for cytokine storm of COVID-19. This review may provide a new approach 
      to discover specific medications using Panax ginseng to control cytokine storm of 
      COVID-19.

AB  - COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) is a contagious illness that has been 
      declared a global epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The 
      coronavirus causes diseases ranging in severity from the common cold to severe 
      respiratory diseases and death. Coronavirus primarily affects blood pressure by 
      attaching to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor. This virus has 
      an impact on multiple organ systems, including the central nervous system, immune 
      system, cardiovascular system, peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, 
      endocrine system, urinary system, skin, and pregnancy. For the prevention of 
      COVID-19, various vaccines such as viral-like particle vaccines, entire 
      inactivated virus vaccines, viral vector vaccines, live attenuated virus 
      vaccines, subunit vaccines, RNA vaccines, and DNA vaccines are now available. 
      Some of the COVID-19 vaccines are reported to cause a variety of adverse effects 
      that range from mild to severe in nature. SARS-CoV-2 replication is controlled by 
      the RNA-Dependent RNA-Polymerase enzyme (RdRp). The availability of FDA-approved 
      anti-RdRp drugs (Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir) 
      as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that tightly bind to its RdRp may aid in the 
      treatment of patients and reduce the risk of the mysterious new form of COVID-19 
      viral infection. RdRp inhibitors, such as remdesivir (an anti-Ebola virus 
      experimental drug) and favipiravir (an anti-influenza drug), inhibit RdRp and 
      thus slow the progression of COVID-19 and associated clinical symptoms, as well 
      as significantly shorten recovery time. Molnupiravir, an orally active RdRp 
      inhibitor and noval broad spectrum antiviral agent, is an isopropyl pro-drug of 
      EIDD-1931 for emergency use. Galidesivir's in vitro and in vivo activities are 
      limited to RNA of human public health concern. Top seeds for antiviral treatments 
      with high potential to combat the SARS-CoV-2 strain include guanosine derivatives 
      (IDX-184), setrobuvir, and YAK. The goal of this review is to compile scattered 
      information on available COVID-19 vaccines and other treatments for protecting 
      the human body from their harmful effects and to provide options for making 
      better choices in a timely manner.

TI  - Human genetic risk of treatment with antiviral nucleoside analog drugs that 
      induce lethal mutagenesis: The special case of molnupiravir.
PG  - 37-63
LID - 10.1002/em.22471 [doi]
AB  - This review considers antiviral nucleoside analog drugs, including ribavirin, 
      favipiravir, and molnupiravir, which induce genome error catastrophe in SARS-CoV 
      or SARS-CoV-2 via lethal mutagenesis as a mode of action. In vitro data indicate 
      that molnupiravir may be 100 times more potent as an antiviral agent than 
      ribavirin or favipiravir. Molnupiravir has recently demonstrated efficacy in a 
      phase 3 clinical trial. Because of its anticipated global use, its relative 
      potency, and the reported in vitro "host" cell mutagenicity of its active 
      principle, β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine, we have reviewed the development of 
      molnupiravir and its genotoxicity safety evaluation, as well as the genotoxicity 
      profiles of three congeners, that is, ribavirin, favipiravir, and 
      5-(2-chloroethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine. We consider the potential genetic risks of 
      molnupiravir on the basis of all available information and focus on the need for 
      additional human genotoxicity data and follow-up in patients treated with 
      molnupiravir and similar drugs. Such human data are especially relevant for 
      antiviral NAs that have the potential of permanently modifying the genomes of 
      treated patients and/or causing human teratogenicity or embryotoxicity. We 
      conclude that the results of preclinical genotoxicity studies and phase 1 human 
      clinical safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics are critical components of 
      drug safety assessments and sentinels of unanticipated adverse health effects. We 
      provide our rationale for performing more thorough genotoxicity testing prior to 
      and within phase 1 clinical trials, including human PIG-A and error corrected 
      next generation sequencing (duplex sequencing) studies in DNA and mitochondrial 
      DNA of patients treated with antiviral NAs that induce genome error catastrophe 
      via lethal mutagenesis.

TI  - Two Green Micellar HPLC and Mathematically Assisted UV Spectroscopic Methods for 
      the Simultaneous Determination of Molnupiravir and Favipiravir as a Novel 
      Combined COVID-19 Antiviral Regimen.
LID - 10.3390/molecules27072330 [doi]
LID - 2330
AB  - Following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, a race was initiated to 
      find a successful regimen for postinfections. Among those trials, a recent study 
      declared the efficacy of an antiviral combination of favipiravir (FAV) and 
      molnupiravir (MLP). The combined regimen helped in a successful 60% eradication 
      of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the lungs of studied hamster models. Moreover, it 
      prevented viral transmission to cohosted sentinels. Because both medications are 
      orally bioavailable, the coformulation of FAV and MLP can be predicted. The 
      developed study is aimed at developing new green and simple methods for the 
      simultaneous determination of FAV and MLP and then at their application in the 
      study of their dissolution behavior if coformulated together. A green micellar 
      HPLC method was validated using an RP-C18 core-shell column (5 μm, 150 × 4.6 mm) 
      and an isocratic mixed micellar mobile phase composed of 0.1 M SDS, 0.01 M 
      Brij-35, and 0.02 M monobasic potassium phosphate mixture and adjusted to pH 3.1 
      at 1.0 mL min(-1) flow rate. The analytes were detected at 230 nm. The run time 
      was less than five minutes under the optimized chromatographic conditions. Four 
      other multivariate chemometric model methods were developed and validated, 
      namely, classical least square (CLS), principal component regression (PCR), 
      partial least squares (PLS-1), and genetic algorithm-partial least squares 
      (GA-PLS-1). The developed models succeeded in resolving the great similarity and 
      overlapping in the FAV and MLP UV spectra unlike the traditional univariate 
      methods. All methods were organic solvent-free, did not require extraction or 
      derivatization steps, and were applied for the construction of the simultaneous 
      dissolution profile for FAV tablets and MLP capsules. The methods revealed that 
      the amount of the simultaneously released cited drugs increases up until reaching 
      a plateau after 15 and 20 min for FAV and MLP, respectively. The greenness was 
      assessed on GAPI and found to be in harmony with green analytical chemistry 
      concepts.

TI  - Ayurvedic formulations: Potential COVID-19 therapeutics?
PG  - 100286
LID - 10.1016/j.phyplu.2022.100286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While Molnupiravir and Paxlovid have recently been approved for use 
      in some countries, there are no widely available treatments for COVID-19, the 
      disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herbal extracts have been used to treat 
      respiratory clinical indications by Ayurvedic medicine practitioners with minimal 
      adverse reactions and intense research efforts are currently under way to develop 
      some of these formulations for COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: Literature search for 
      in silico, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies on the topic of Ayurvedic 
      formulations for potential COVID-19 treatment, in order to present the current 
      state of current knowledge by integrating information across all systems. 
      RESULTS: The search yielded 20 peer reviewed articles on in silico studies 
      examining the interaction of phytoconstituents of popular Ayurvedic formulations 
      with SARS-CoV-2 components and its receptors; five articles on preclinical 
      investigations of the ability of selected Ayurvedic formulations to inhibit 
      functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins; and 51 completed clinical trials on the 
      efficacy of using Ayurvedic formulations for treatment of mild to moderate 
      COVID-19. Clinical data was available from 17 of the 51 trials. There was a 
      considerable overlap between formulations used in the in silico studies and the 
      clinical trials. This finding was unexpected as there is no clearly stated 
      alignment between studies and the traditional pathway to drug discovery- basic 
      discovery leading to in vitro and in vivo proof of concept, followed by 
      validation in clinical trials. This was further demonstrated in the majority of 
      the in silico studies where focus was on potential antiviral mechanisms, while 
      the clinical trials were focused on patient recovery using oral treatments. In 
      all 17 clinical trials where data was available, Ayurvedic treatments lead to a 
      shorter period to recovery in participants with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The most 
      commonly used Ayurvedic treatments for management of respiratory symptoms 
      associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection appear to have prophylactic and/or 
      therapeutic properties. It would be of particular interest to assess synergistic 
      and concomitant systemic effects and antiviral activities of individual 
      phytoconstituents and their combinations in the Ayurvedic treatments.

TI  - Making Statistical Sense of the Molnupiravir MOVe-OUT Clinical Trial.
LID - tpmd211339 [pii]
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.21-1339 [doi]
AB  - Oral therapies for the early treatment of COVID-19 may prevent disease 
      progression and health system overcrowding. A new oral therapeutic named 
      molnupiravir has been promoted as providing an approximately 50% reduction in 
      death or the need for hospitalization. The clinical trial evaluating this drug 
      was stopped early at the recommendation of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board 
      after approximately 50% of the sample had been recruited. At the point of 
      discontinuing the trial, approximately 90% of the planned sample had been 
      recruited and had available follow-up data accessible. We discuss issues about 
      the study conduct, analysis, and interpretation, including 1) the authors and 
      sponsors presented the interim analysis as the primary analysis; 2) communication 
      between sponsors and the Data Safety and Monitoring Board was insufficient; 3) 
      the treatment effects reverse when examining only the post-interim analysis 
      population, and are substantially attenuated when examining the full data; 4) the 
      choice of primary analysis is incorrect; 5) analysis of lost-to-follow-up 
      patients favors the study drug; and 6) other known molnupiravir trials were not 
      presented in the primary study findings. As a result of methodological and 
      statistical concerns, it seems that external trials, separate from those 
      supported by the sponsoring company, are required to determine the utility of 
      this drug.

AB  - Recently, remdesivir and molnupiravir were approved for treating COVID-19 caused 
      by SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, little is known about the impact of these drugs 
      on other viruses preexisted in COVID-19 patients. Here we report that remdesivir 
      but not molnupiravir induced lytic reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated 
      herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), two major oncogenic 
      herpesviruses. Remdesivir induced mature virion production from latently infected 
      cells. Mechanistic studies showed that remdesivir induced KSHV and EBV 
      reactivation by regulating several intracellular signaling pathways.

PG  - 275-289

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected so far over 250 million people 
      and caused the death of over 5 million worldwide. Aging, diabetes, and 
      cardiovascular diseases, conditions with preexisting impaired endothelial 
      functions predispose to COVID-19. While respiratory epithelium is the main route 
      of virus entry, the endothelial cells (ECs) lining pulmonary blood vessels are 
      also an integral part of lung injury in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 not only 
      affects the lungs and respiratory system but also gastrointestinal (GI) tract, 
      liver, pancreas, kidneys, heart, brain, and skin. Blood vessels are likely 
      conduits for the virus dissemination to these distant organs. Importantly, ECs 
      are also critical for vascular regeneration during injury/lesions healing and 
      restoration of vascular network. The World Journal of Gastroenterology has 
      published in last two years over 67 outstanding papers on COVID-19 infection with 
      a focus on the GI tract, liver, pancreas, etc., however, the role of the 
      endothelial and vascular components as major targets for COVID-19-induced tissue 
      injury, spreading to various organs, and injury healing have not been 
      sufficiently emphasized. In the present article, we focus on these subjects and 
      on current treatments including the most recent oral drugs molnupiravir and 
      paxlovid that show a dramatic, significant efficacy in controlling severe 
      COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Numerous treatments exist for COVID-19, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, 
      although most are not well established; among these are several small molecule 
      antiviral agents. Intravenous remdesivir is an established treatment worldwide 
      for inpatients and in some countries is also available for use in 
      non-hospitalised high risk patients to prevent progression to severe disease and 
      hospitalization. Oral molnupiravir and oral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir are also 
      available in several countries to prevent progression to severe disease and 
      hospitalization for high-risk outpatients. Many other antiviral small molecules 
      that may have therapeutic potential are under investigation in clinical trials. 
      This article provides a summary of key molecular targets, pharmacology and 
      preliminary data on the efficacy and safety of small molecule antiviral agents 
      being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.

      Drugs Repurposing to Molnupiravir Approval.

LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S354841 [doi]
AB  - The rising outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 continues to unfold all over the world. The 
      development of novel effective antiviral drugs to fight against SARS-CoV-2 is a 
      time cost. As a result, some specific FDA-approved drugs have already been 
      repurposed and authorized for COVID-19 treatment. The repurposed drugs used were 
      either antiviral or non-antiviral drugs. Accordingly, the present review 
      thoroughly focuses on the repurposing efficacy of these drugs including clinical 
      trials experienced, the combination therapies used, the novel methods followed 
      for treatment, and their future perspective. Therefore, drug repurposing was 
      regarded as an effective avenue for COVID-19 treatment. Recently, molnupiravir is 
      a prodrug antiviral medication that was approved in the United Kingdom in 
      November 2021 for the treatment of COVID-19. On the other hand, PF-07321332 is an 
      oral antiviral drug developed by Pfizer. For the treatment of COVID-19, the 
      PF-07321332/ritonavir combination medication is used in Phase III studies and was 
      marketed as Paxlovid. Herein, we represented the almost history of combating 
      COVID-19 from repurposing to the recently available oral anti-SARS-CoV-2 
      candidates, as a new hope to end the current pandemic.

AB  - As SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve and spread with the emergence of new variants, 
      interest in small molecules with broad-spectrum antiviral activity has grown. One 
      such molecule, Molnupiravir (MOV; other names: MK-4482, EIDD-2801), a 
      ribonucleoside analogue, has emerged as an effective SARS-CoV-2 treatment by 
      inducing catastrophic viral mutagenesis during replication. However, there are 
      growing concerns as MOV's potential to induce host DNA mutagenesis remains an 
      open question. Analysis of RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2-infected MOV-treated 
      golden hamster lung biopsies confirmed MOV's efficiency in stopping SARS-CoV-2 
      replication. Importantly, MOV treatment did not increase mutations in the host 
      lung cells. This finding calls for additional mutation calls on host biopsies 
      from more proliferative tissues to fully explore MOV's hypothesized mutagenic 
      risk.

TI  - A computational comparative analysis of the binding mechanism of molnupiravir's 
      active metabolite to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of wild-type and Delta 
      subvariant AY.4 of SARS-CoV-2.
LID - 10.1002/jcb.30226 [doi]
AB  - The antiviral drug molnupiravir targets the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA 
      polymerase (RdRP) enzyme. Early treatment with molnupiravir reduced the risk of 
      hospitalization or death in at-risk, unvaccinated adults with COVID-19, according 
      to phase 3 clinical trials. Many mutations have occurred within this virus as a 
      result of its widespread distribution. The current study sought to determine 
      whether mutations in the RdRP of Delta subvariant AY.4 (D-AY.4 RdRP) influence 
      the interaction of the enzyme with molnupiravir triphosphate (MTP), the active 
      metabolite of molnupiravir. The interactions between the wild-type (WT) RdRP and 
      D-AY.4 RdRP with MTP were evaluated based on molecular docking and dynamic 
      simulation (MD) studies. The results show that the MTP interaction is stronger 
      and more stable with D-AY.4 RdRP than with WT RdRP. This study provides insight 
      into the potential significance of administering MTP to patients infected with 
      D-AY.4 RdRP, which may have a more favorable chance of alleviating the illness. 
      According to the findings of this study, MTP has a high likelihood of becoming 
      widely used as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. The fact that MTP is not only cytotoxic 
      but also mutagenic to mammalian cells, as well as the possibility that it may 
      cause DNA damage in the host, have all been raised as potential concerns.

TI  - Drug interaction risk between cardioprotective drugs and drugs used in treatment 
      of COVID-19: A evidence-based review from six databases.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This Review discusses the potential drug interactions risk 
      between Drugs used in treating COVID-19 infection and Drugs used in treating 
      comorbid conditions (Diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular illness). METHOD: Six 
      Databases were consulted a) Micromedex drug interaction b) Medicine complete.com 
      c) Liverpool Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies d) Epocrates e) 
      Medscape f) drugs.com. To acquire information on possible interaction effects 
      between drugs used for COVID-19 treatment such as atazanavir, 
      lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir, paxlovid(nirmatrelvir/ritonavir), 
      dexamethasone, azithromycin, chloroquine, and FDA approved monoclonal antibodies 
      with primarily used antidiabetic drugs, antihypertensive drugs, and drugs acting 
      on the cardiovascular system. RESULTS: Potential interaction effects such as 
      worsening glycemic control were prominent with lopinavir/ritonavir and the 
      primarily used antidiabetic drugs, which needs dosage adjustment and close 
      monitoring. The risk of hypotension and irregular heart rhythm is the potential 
      interaction effects with concomitant use of drugs for COVID-19 treatment and 
      antihypertensive drugs. Caution is advised with drugs such as atazanavir and 
      lopinavir/ritonavir when concomitantly used in treating comorbid conditions. 
      Drugs such as remdesivir, molnupiravir, and some monoclonal antibodies are safer 
      in use with drugs used in treating the comorbid condition. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-drug 
      interaction remains one of the significant factors in altering the therapeutic 
      efficacy. Drugs used to manage comorbid conditions may influence the COVID-19 
      treatment with potential interaction effects. These enhance the view on safety 
      concerns about the drug interaction risk in managing COVID-19 infection in 
      patients with comorbid conditions. This primary evidence may concern preventing 
      potential or unintentional effects resulting from Drug-drug interaction, 
      Improving patient quality of life.

AB  - Omicron has shown immune escape from neutralizing antibodies generated through 
      previous infection or vaccination. It could evade the protection provided by mAbs 
      being used in clinics for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients. 
      Booster dose is recommended to elevate the protective levels of antibodies in 
      COVID‐19 vaccinated individuals. The development of powerful oral antiviral drugs 
      such as Molnupiravir and Paxlovid have shown promising clinical results and 
      raised new hopes of COVID‐19 treatment. High efforts are being made to develop 
      highly efficacious vaccines, and by implementing appropriate prevention and 
      control strategies to counter Omicron.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has brought an unprecedented public health crisis and 
      persistently threatens to humanity. With tireless efforts from scientists around 
      the world, understanding of the biology of coronavirus has been greatly enhanced 
      over the past 2 years. Structural biology has demonstrated its powerful impact on 
      uncovering structures and functions for the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins 
      and guided the development of drugs and vaccines against COVID-19. In this 
      review, we summarize current progress in the structural biology of SARS-CoV-2 and 
      discuss important biological issues that remain to be addressed. We present the 
      examples of structure-based design of Pfizer's novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug 
      PF-07321332 (Paxlovid), Merck's nucleotide inhibitor molnupiravir (Lagevrio), and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a substantial increase 
      in mortality and economic and social disruption. The absence of US Food and Drug 
      Administration-approved drugs for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) highlights the need for new therapeutic drugs to combat COVID-19. 
      METHODS: The present study proposed a fuzzy hierarchical optimization framework 
      for identifying potential antiviral targets for COVID-19. The objectives in the 
      decision-making problem were not only to evaluate the elimination of the virus 
      growth, but also to minimize side effects causing treatment. The identified 
      candidate targets could promote processes of drug discovery and development. 
      SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: Our gene-centric method revealed that dihydroorotate 
      dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibition could reduce viral biomass growth and metabolic 
      deviation by 99.4% and 65.6%, respectively, and increase cell viability by 70.4%. 
      We also identified two-target combinations that could completely block viral 
      biomass growth and more effectively prevent metabolic deviation. We also 
      discovered that the inhibition of two antiviral metabolites, cytidine 
      triphosphate (CTP) and uridine-5'-triphosphate (UTP), exhibits effects similar to 
      those of molnupiravir, which is undergoing phase III clinical trials. Our 
      predictions also indicate that CTP and UTP inhibition blocks viral RNA 
      replication through a similar mechanism to that of molnupiravir.

TI  - Pyrimidine inhibitors synergize with nucleoside analogues to block SARS-CoV-2.
PG  - 134-140
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-04482-x [doi]
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than 261 million people and has led to 
      more than 5 million deaths in the past year and a half(1) ( https://www.who.org/ 
      ). Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection typically develop mild-to-severe 
      flu-like symptoms, whereas infection of a subset of individuals leads to 
      severe-to-fatal clinical outcomes(2). Although vaccines have been rapidly 
      developed to combat SARS-CoV-2, there has been a dearth of antiviral 
      therapeutics. There is an urgent need for therapeutics, which has been amplified 
      by the emerging threats of variants that may evade vaccines. Large-scale efforts 
      are underway to identify antiviral drugs. Here we screened approximately 18,000 
      drugs for antiviral activity using live virus infection in human respiratory 
      cells and validated 122 drugs with antiviral activity and selectivity against 
      SARS-CoV-2. Among these candidates are 16 nucleoside analogues, the largest 
      category of clinically used antivirals. This included the antivirals remdesivir 
      and molnupiravir, which have been approved for use in COVID-19. RNA viruses rely 
      on a high supply of nucleoside triphosphates from the host to efficiently 
      replicate, and we identified a panel of host nucleoside biosynthesis inhibitors 
      as antiviral. Moreover, we found that combining pyrimidine biosynthesis 
      inhibitors with antiviral nucleoside analogues synergistically inhibits 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo against emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2, 
      suggesting a clinical path forward.

      Synthesis and Greener Pastures Biological Study.
LID - 10.3390/molecules27020488 [doi]
LID - 488
AB  - A novel series of 1-aryl-N-[4-phenyl-5-(arylazo)thiazol-2-yl)methanimines has 
      been synthesized via the condensation of 2-amino-4-phenyl-5-arylazothiazole with 
      various aromatic aldehydes. The synthesized imines were characterized by 
      spectroscopic techniques, namely (1)H and (13)C-NMR, FTIR, MS, and Elemental 
      Analysis. A molecular comparative docking study for 3a-f was calculated, with 
      reference to two approved drugs, Molnupiravir and Remdesivir, using 7BQY (M(pro); 
      PDB code 7BQY; resolution: 1.7 A°) under identical conditions. The binding scores 
      against 7BQY were in the range of -7.7 to -8.7 kcal/mol for 3a-f. The high scores 
      of the compounds indicated an enhanced binding affinity of the molecules to the 
      receptor. This is due to the hydrophobic interactions and multi-hydrogen bonds 
      between 3a-f ligands and the receptor's active amino acid residues. The main aim 
      of using in silco molecular docking was to rank 3a-f with respect to the approved 
      drugs, Molnupiravir and Remdesivir, using free energy methods as greener 
      pastures. A further interesting comparison presented the laydown of the ligands 
      before and after molecular docking. These results and other supporting 
      statistical analyses suggested that ligands 3a-f deserve further investigation in 
      the context of potential therapeutic agents for COVID-19. Free-cost, PASS, 
      SwissADME, and Way2drug were used in this research paper to determine the 
      possible biological activities and cytotoxicity of 3a-f.

TI  - Advances in the Omicron variant development.
LID - 10.1111/joim.13478 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 has spread worldwide, 
      leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic, on 11 March 
      2020. Variants of concern have appeared at regular intervals-Alpha, Beta, Gamma, 
      Delta, and now Omicron. Omicron variant, first identified in Botswana in November 
      2021, is rapidly becoming the dominant circulating variant. In this review, we 
      provide an overview regarding the molecular profile of the Omicron variant, 
      epidemiology, transmissibility, the impact on vaccines, as well as vaccine 
      escape, and finally, we report the pharmacological agents able to block the 
      endocellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 or to inhibit its viral replication. The Omicron 
      has more than 50 mutations, of which the spike protein has 26-35 amino acids 
      different from the original SARS-CoV-2 virus or the Delta, some of which are 
      associated with humoral immune escape potential and greater transmissibility. 
      Omicron has a significant growth advantage over Delta, leading to rapid spread 
      with higher incidence levels. The disease so far has been mild compared to the 
      Delta. The two vaccination doses offer little or no protection against Omicron 
      infection while the booster doses provide significant protection against mild 
      illness and likely offer even greater levels of protection against serious 
      illness. Recently, new oral antiviral agents such as molnupiravir and paxlovid 
      have been approved and represent important therapeutic alternatives to antiviral 
      remdesivir. In addition, monoclonal antibodies such as casirivimab/imdevimab bind 
      different epitopes of the spike protein receptor; is this class of drugs 
      effective against the Omicron variant? However, more research is needed to define 
      whether Omicron is indeed more infectious and whether the vaccines, monoclonal 
      antibodies, and antivirals currently available are effective.

TI  - Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of oral antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 in 
      Korea.
PG  - e2022034
LID - 10.4178/epih.e2022034 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Countries authorized the emergency use of oral antiviral agents in 
      patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of 
      introducing these novel oral antiviral agents to reduce the number of severe 
      patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the burden of the medical systems. METHODS: 
      From the existing COVID-19 Epidemiology Model, we projected the number of people 
      who require hospital/ICU admissions in Korea in 2022. Treatment scenarios 
      included (i) all adults, (ii) elderly, and (iii) adult patients with underlying 
      diseases administered molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir vis-a-vis standard 
      care. Under the current health systems capacity, we calculate the incremental 
      cost per severe patient averted and per net admission for each scenario relative 
      to standard care. RESULTS: An estimated, 236,510 COVID-19 patients would require 
      hospital/ICU in Korea in 2022 with standard care. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (87% 
      efficacy) is expected to reduce the number of severe patients requiring 
      hospital/ICU admissions by 80%, 24%, and 17% (25%, 8%, and 4% by molnupiravir 
      with 30% efficacy) when targeting all adults, adults with underlying diseases, 
      and elderly patients, respectively. Administration of Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may 
      be cost-effective as $1,454, $8,878, and $8,964 (while molnupiravir may be less 
      likely cost-effective as $7,915, $28,492, $29,575) per severe patient averted if 
      targeted respectively to the target group mentioned above, compared to standard 
      care. CONCLUSION: In Korea, oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment of symptomatic 
      COVID-19 patients can be highly cost-effective if targeted to elderly patients 
      while substantially reducing hospital admission demand below the health systems 
      capacity limit if all adult patients are targeted compared to standard care.

LID - 10.4155/tde-2022-0011 [doi]
AB  - This Industry Update provides an overview of the some of the key events in the 
      pharmaceutical world in December 2021. In this month Eli Lilly & Co invested 
      heavily in drug discovery with deals with Regor Therapeutics on metabolic 
      diseases, and Foghorn Therapeutics on cancer and other diseases caused by faults 
      in the regulation of chromatin unpacking and repacking. Treatments for Covid-19 
      also feature heavily with the emergency authorization of molnupiravir and 
      Paxlovid™ in the USA, and BiondVax's collaboration agreement with Max Planck and 
      the University Medical Center, Göttingham on their alpaca-based single-chain 
      antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Lastly, this month brought 
      good news on several diseases with poor prognosis and no or limited treatment 
      options. This included Novartis's acquisition of Gyroscope and its gene therapy 
      for age-related macular degeneration, Merck's purchase of Chord Therapeutics and 
      the rights of develop cladribine for generalized myasthenia gravis and 
      neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, positive phase III interim results for 
      UCB's, Bimzelx(®), in ankylosing spondylitis and AstraZeneca and Ionis 
      co-development and commercialization deal on eplontersen for transthyretin 
      amyloidosis.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every country in the world. With more than 
      400 million cases and more than 5.5 million deaths. The FDA either approved or 
      authorized the emergency use for three vaccines against COVID-19. The treatment 
      options of COVID-19 are very limited. Multiple complementary and alternative 
      medicine modalities were suggested to be efficacious in the treatment of COVID-19 
      such as Thymoquinone. The effects of Thymoquinone have been examined and multiple 
      studies indicate a promising beneficial effect. However, the current body of 
      research is limited in terms of its scope, quality, and quantity. While 
      higher-quality studies are required, physicians do not routinely recommend the 
      use of marketed supplements of natural products, including Thymoquinone for 
      COVID-19. Given the numerous suggested positive effects of Thymoquinone, 
      including anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, additional research is 
      required to confirm or refute these promising benefits. Complementary and 
      alternative medicine is an area that requires additional evidence-based practice 
      and research to confirm effects observed in clinical practice.

TI  - Efficacy of the use of mefenamic acid combined with standard medical care vs. 
      standard medical care alone for the treatment of COVID‑19: A randomized 
      double‑blind placebo‑controlled trial.
LID - 29 [pii]
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2022.5084 [doi]
AB  - Mefenamic acid is a non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug exhibiting a wide range 
      of anti‑inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic and probable antiviral activities. 
      The present study evaluated the efficacy of treatment with mefenamic acid 
      combined with standard medical care vs. standard medical care plus a placebo in 
      ambulatory patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19; nasal/oropharyngeal 
      swabs reverse transcription‑PCR test results positive for severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). The present study is a phase II prospective, 
      two‑arm, parallel‑group, randomized, double‑blind placebo‑controlled clinical 
      trial which analyzed 36 patients. Two aspects were evaluated during the 14‑day 
      follow‑up period: i) The time for reaching a patient acceptable symptom state 
      (PASS), and ii) the last day of each COVID‑19 symptom presentation. Adverse 
      effects were evaluated. The clinical severity for all the patients in the study 
      was mild (88.9%) and moderate (11.1%). The control (placebo) group achieved PASS 
      on day 8.0±1.3, compared with day 4.4±0.8 in the mefenamic acid group (P=0.020, 
      Kaplan‑Meier analyses using log‑rank tests). Patients that received mefenamic 
      acid plus standard medical care had a ~16‑fold higher probability of achieving 
      PASS on day 8 (adjusted RR, 15.57; 95% CI, 1.22‑198.71; P=0.035), compared with 
      the placebo plus standard medical care group. All symptoms lasted for fewer days 
      in the mefenamic acid group, compared with the placebo group; however, only the 
      symptoms of headache (P=0.008), retro‑orbital eye pain (P=0.049), and sore throat 
      (P=0.029) exhibited statistically significant differences. The experimental 
      treatment produced no severe adverse effects. On the whole, the present study 
      demonstrates that the administration of mefenamic acid markedly reduced the 
      symptomatology and time to reach PASS in ambulatory patients with COVID‑19. Due 
      to its probable antiviral effects and potent anti‑inflammatory mechanisms, 
      mefenamic acid may prove to be useful in the treatment of COVID‑19, in 
      combination with other drugs, including the new antivirals (remdesivir, 
      molnupiravir, or favipiravir). However, future studies are also required to 
      confirm these findings.

TI  - Combination of antiviral drugs inhibits SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and exonuclease and

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader, which removes nucleotide 
      inhibitors such as Remdesivir that are incorporated into the viral RNA during 
      replication, reducing the efficacy of these drugs for treating COVID-19. 
      Combinations of inhibitors of both the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the 
      exonuclease could overcome this deficiency. Here we report the identification of 
      hepatitis C virus NS5A inhibitors Pibrentasvir and Ombitasvir as SARS-CoV-2 
      exonuclease inhibitors. In the presence of Pibrentasvir, RNAs terminated with the 
      active forms of the prodrugs Sofosbuvir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir 
      and AT-527 were largely protected from excision by the exonuclease, while in the 
      absence of Pibrentasvir, there was rapid excision. Due to its unique structure, 
      Tenofovir-terminated RNA was highly resistant to exonuclease excision even in the 
      absence of Pibrentasvir. Viral cell culture studies also demonstrate significant 
      synergy using this combination strategy. This study supports the use of 
      combination drugs that inhibit both the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and exonuclease for 
      effective COVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Lethal Mutagenesis of RNA Viruses and Approved Drugs with Antiviral Mutagenic 
      Activity.
LID - 10.3390/v14040841 [doi]
LID - 841
AB  - In RNA viruses, a small increase in their mutation rates can be sufficient to 
      exceed their threshold of viability. Lethal mutagenesis is a therapeutic strategy 
      based on the use of mutagens, driving viral populations to extinction. Extinction 
      catastrophe can be experimentally induced by promutagenic nucleosides in cell 
      culture models. The loss of HIV infectivity has been observed after passage in 
      5-hydroxydeoxycytidine or 5,6-dihydro-5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine while producing a 
      two-fold increase in the viral mutation frequency. Among approved nucleoside 
      analogs, experiments with polioviruses and other RNA viruses suggested that 
      ribavirin can be mutagenic, although its mechanism of action is not clear. 
      Favipiravir and molnupiravir exert an antiviral effect through lethal 
      mutagenesis. Both drugs are broad-spectrum antiviral agents active against RNA 
      viruses. Favipiravir incorporates into viral RNA, affecting the G→A and C→U 
      transition rates. Molnupiravir (a prodrug of β-d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine) has been 
      recently approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Its triphosphate 
      derivative can be incorporated into viral RNA and extended by the coronavirus RNA 
      polymerase. Incorrect base pairing and inefficient extension by the polymerase 
      promote mutagenesis by increasing the G→A and C→U transition frequencies. Despite 
      having remarkable antiviral action and resilience to drug resistance, 
      carcinogenic risks and genotoxicity are important concerns limiting their 
      extended use in antiviral therapy.

TI  - Characterization of the First SARS-CoV-2 Isolates from Aotearoa New Zealand as 
      Part of a Rapid Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - 10.3390/v14020366 [doi]
LID - 366
AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has wreaked havoc 
      across the globe for the last two years. More than 300 million cases and over 5 
      million deaths later, we continue battling the first real pandemic of the 21st 
      century. SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly, reaching most countries within the first half 
      of 2020, and New Zealand was not an exception. Here, we describe the first 
      isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variants during the initial virus 
      outbreak in New Zealand. Patient-derived nasopharyngeal samples were used to 
      inoculate Vero cells and, three to four days later, a cytopathic effect was 
      observed in seven viral cultures. Viral growth kinetics was characterized using 
      Vero and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. The identity of the viruses was verified by 
      RT-qPCR, Western blot, indirect immunofluorescence assays, and electron 
      microscopy. Whole-genome sequences were analyzed using two different yet 
      complementary deep sequencing platforms (MiSeq/Illumina and Ion PGM™/Ion 
      Torrent™), classifying the viruses as SARS-CoV-2 B.55, B.31, B.1, or B.1.369 
      based on the Pango Lineage nomenclature. All seven SARS-CoV-2 isolates were 
      susceptible to remdesivir (EC(50) values from 0.83 to 2.42 µM) and 
      β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (molnupiravir, EC(50) values from 0.96 to 1.15 µM) but 
      not to favipiravir (>10 µM). Interestingly, four SARS-CoV-2 isolates, carrying 
      the D614G substitution originally associated with increased transmissibility, 
      were more susceptible (2.4-fold) to a commercial monoclonal antibody targeting 
      the spike glycoprotein than the wild-type viruses. Altogether, this seminal work 
      allowed for early access to SARS-CoV-2 isolates in New Zealand, paving the way 
      for numerous clinical and scientific research projects in the country, including 
      the development and validation of diagnostic assays, antiviral strategies, and a 
      national COVID-19 vaccine development program.

AB  - There is an urgent need to bring new antivirals to SARS-CoV-2 to the market. 
      Indeed, in the last 3 months, we have seen at least two new antivirals approved, 
      molnupiravir and paxlovid. Both are older established antivirals that show some 
      efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. The work by Chang et al (2022) in the current issue 
      of EMBO Molecular Medicine explores the use of short interfering RNAs to directly 
      target SARS-CoV-2 and shows that RNAi is an effective approach to reducing, or 
      even eliminating viral replication, depending on the experimental setting. This 
      antiviral effect results in significant prevention of infection-related pathology 
      in animals. The key feature of this approach, besides its simplicity as naked 
      siRNAs, is that all current variants are covered by this treatment.

TI  - Availability of oral antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the requirement 
      for an ethical prescribing approach.

LID - 10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00119-0 [doi]
AB  - The first two oral antivirals, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, are now 
      becoming available in many countries. These medicines will be indicated to treat 
      mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients who are at high risk of 
      progressing to severe COVID-19. These antivirals should be prescribed within 5 
      days of symptom onset, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection has been confirmed. 
      However, the availability of these antivirals will be scarce for some time due to 
      manufacturing constraints. Each country should establish a policy on the 
      conditions under which these antivirals can be prescribed. Such a policy should 
      be based on the fulfilment of five ethical elements: transparency, relevance, 
      appeals, enforcement, and fairness. Following the principles of distributive 
      justice, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir should be prescribed according 
      to a hierarchy of predicted efficacy, ideally on the basis of an evidence-based 
      scoring system. The placebo-controlled randomised trials that supported the 
      temporary authorisation of these two antivirals were conducted in unvaccinated 
      patients with COVID-19, so an evidence-based prescription practice would only use 
      these drugs for unvaccinated patients until further data become available. 
      However, in the countries that authorised these antivirals in 2021 (the UK and 
      the USA), both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients meeting particular 
      requirements have access to these antivirals. Due to the complexity of 
      prioritisation, national health authorities should start issuing their draft 
      policies as soon as possible and these policies should be regularly updated. The 
      effectiveness of these antivirals against the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 must 
      be urgently assessed. Once implemented, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 
      must show their effectiveness and safety in the real world, and health systems 
      must be adequately adapted for the correct use of these antivirals.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike mediated immune escape and tropism shift.
LID - rs.3.rs-1191837 [pii]
LID - 10.21203/rs.3.rs-1191837/v1 [doi]
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant emerged in late 2021 and is characterised by 
      multiple spike mutations across all spike domains. Here we show that Omicron BA.1 
      has higher affinity for ACE2 compared to Delta, and confers very significant 
      evasion of therapeutic monoclonal and vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralising 
      antibodies after two doses. mRNA vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and 
      broadens neutralisation. Importantly, antiviral drugs remdesevir and molnupiravir 
      retain efficacy against Omicron BA.1. We found that in human nasal epithelial 3D 
      cultures replication was similar for both Omicron and Delta. However, in lower 
      airway organoids, Calu-3 lung cells and gut adenocarcinoma cell lines live 
      Omicron virus demonstrated significantly lower replication in comparison to 
      Delta. We noted that despite presence of mutations predicted to favour spike 
      S1/S2 cleavage, the spike protein is less efficiently cleaved in live Omicron 
      virions compared to Delta virions. We mapped the replication differences between 
      the variants to entry efficiency using spike pseudotyped virus (PV) entry assays. 
      The defect for Omicron PV in specific cell types correlated with higher cellular 
      RNA expression of TMPRSS2, and accordingly knock down of TMPRSS2 impacted Delta 
      entry to a greater extent as compared to Omicron. Furthermore, drug inhibitors 
      targeting specific entry pathways demonstrated that the Omicron spike 
      inefficiently utilises the cellular protease TMPRSS2 that mediates cell entry via 
      plasma membrane fusion. Instead, we demonstrate that Omicron spike has greater 
      dependency on cell entry via the endocytic pathway requiring the activity of 
      endosomal cathepsins to cleave spike. Consistent with suboptimal S1/S2 cleavage 
      and inability to utilise TMPRSS2, syncytium formation by the Omicron spike was 
      dramatically impaired compared to the Delta spike. Overall, Omicron appears to 
      have gained significant evasion from neutralising antibodies whilst maintaining 
      sensitivity to antiviral drugs targeting the polymerase. Omicron has shifted 
      cellular tropism away from TMPRSS2 expressing cells that are enriched in cells 
      found in the lower respiratory and GI tracts, with implications for altered 
      pathogenesis.

TI  - Ivermectin Does Not Protect against SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the Syrian Hamster 
      Model.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10030633 [doi]
LID - 633
AB  - Ivermectin, an FDA-approved antiparasitic drug, has been reported to have in 
      vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Increased off-label use of ivermectin for 
      COVID-19 has been reported. We here assessed the effect of ivermectin in Syrian 
      hamsters infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Beta (B.1.351) variant. Infected animals 
      received a clinically relevant dose of ivermectin (0.4 mg/kg subcutaneously 
      dosed) once daily for four consecutive days after which the effect was 
      quantified. Ivermectin monotherapy did not reduce lung viral load and even 
      significantly worsened SARS-CoV-2-induced lung pathology. Additionally, it did 
      not potentiate the activity of molnupiravir (Lagevrio(TM)) when combined with 
      this drug. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence that ivermectin 
      does not result in a beneficial effect in the treatment of COVID-19. These 
      findings are important given the increasing, dangerous off-label use of 
      ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current article reviews the latest information on the 
      epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostics, clinical management and prevention 
      of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RECENT FINDINGS: Atypical pneumonia due 
      to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 emerged in December 2019 in a 
      market in Wuhan, China and rapidly evolved into a pandemic in March 2020. Viral 
      loads of patients with COVID-19 peak in the first week of illness around day 2-4 
      and hence there is very high-transmission potential causing community outbreaks. 
      Asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission is a hallmark of COVID-19. Several 
      variants of concern (VOC) have emerged over the last 2 years and Omicron is the 
      predominant variant in many countries. PCR is the standard diagnostic test while 
      rapid antigen test is a useful supplementary test. Serology tests provide 
      indirect evidence of infection 1-2 weeks after the onset of symptoms. 
      Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir are oral antiviral agents that may reduce the risk 
      of hospitalization and deaths if administered early to high-risk subjects. 
      Remdesivir, baricitinib, anti-IL-6 tocilizumab and dexamethasone are frequently 
      used for treatment of patients with respiratory failure. SUMMARY: COVID-19 
      pandemic progresses relentlessly with substantial morbidity and mortality 
      especially in unvaccinated subjects. Mass COVID-19 vaccinations are the most 
      important measure for control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic COVID-19 created by its severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant, known for producing a 
      very severe acute respiratory syndrome, has created an unprecedented situation by 
      its continual assault around the world. The crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 
      variant has been a global challenge, calling to mitigate this unprecedented 
      pandemic that has engulfed the whole world. Since the outbreak and spread of 
      COVID-19, many researchers globally have been grappling to find new clinically 
      trialed active drugs with anti-COVID-19 activity, from antimalarial drugs to JAK 
      inhibitors, antiviral drugs, immune suppressants, and so forth. This article 
      presents a brief discussion on the activity and synthesis of some active 
      molecules such as favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, pirfenidone, remdesivir, 
      lopinavir, camostat, chloroquine, baricitinib, molnupiravir, and so forth, which 
      are under trial.

AB  - DNA (2'-deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) play diverse functional 
      roles in biology and disease. Despite being comprised primarily of only four 
      cognate nucleobases, nucleic acids can adopt complex three-dimensional 
      structures, and RNA in particular, can catalyze biochemical reactions to regulate 
      a wide variety of biological processes. Such chemical versatility is due in part 
      to the phenomenon of nucleobase tautomerism, whereby the bases can adopt 
      multiple, yet distinct isomeric forms, known as tautomers. For nucleobases, 
      tautomers refer to structural isomers that differ from one another by the 
      position of protons. By altering the position of protons on nucleobases, many of 
      which play critical roles for hydrogen bonding and base pairing interactions, 
      tautomerism has profound effects on the biochemical processes involving nucleic 
      acids. For example, the transient formation of minor tautomers during replication 
      could generate spontaneous mutations. These mutations could arise from the 
      stabilization of mismatches, in the active site of polymerases, in conformations 
      involving minor tautomers that are indistinguishable from canonical base pairs. 
      In this review, we discuss the evidence for tautomerism in DNA, and its 
      consequences to the fidelity of DNA replication. Also reviewed are RNA systems, 
      such as the riboswitches and self-cleaving ribozymes, in which tautomerism plays 
      a functional role in ligand recognition and catalysis, respectively. We also 
      discuss tautomeric nucleoside analogs that are efficacious as antiviral drug 
      candidates such as molnupiravir for coronaviruses and KP1212 for HIV. The 
      antiviral efficacy of these analogs is due, in part, to their ability to exist in 
      multiple tautomeric forms and induce mutations in the replicating viral genomes. 
      From a technical standpoint, minor tautomers of nucleobases are challenging to 
      identify directly because they are rare and interconvert on a fast, millisecond 
      to nanosecond, time scale. Nevertheless, many approaches including biochemical, 
      structural, computational and spectroscopic methods have been developed to study 
      tautomeric dynamics in RNA and DNA systems, and in antiviral nucleoside analogs. 
      An overview of these methods and their applications is included here.

TI  - Thermodynamic and structural insights into the repurposing of drugs that bind to 
      SARS-CoV-2 main protease.
PG  - 123-131
LID - 10.1039/d1me00124h [doi]
AB  - Although researchers have been working tirelessly since the COVID-19 outbreak, so 
      far only three drugs - remdesivir, ronapreve and molnupiravir - have been 
      approved for use in some countries which directly target the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
      Given the slow pace and substantial costs of new drug discovery and development, 
      together with the urgency of the matter, repurposing of existing drugs for the 
      ongoing disease is an attractive proposition. In a recent study, a 
      high-throughput X-ray crystallographic screen was performed for a selection of 
      drugs which have been approved or are in clinical trials. Thirty-seven compounds 
      have been identified from drug libraries all of which bind to the SARS-CoV-2 main 
      protease (3CL(pro)). In the current study, we use molecular dynamics simulation 
      and an ensemble-based free energy approach, namely, enhanced sampling of 
      molecular dynamics with approximation of continuum solvent (ESMACS), to 
      investigate a subset of the aforementioned compounds. The drugs studied here are 
      highly diverse, interacting with different binding sites and/or subsites of 
      3CL(pro). The predicted free energies are compared with experimental results 
      wherever they are available and they are found to be in excellent agreement. Our 
      study also provides detailed energetic insights into the nature of the associated 
      drug-protein binding, in turn shedding light on the design and discovery of 
      potential drugs.

AB  - Novel SARS coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that was identified 
      and spread from Wuhan in 2019. On January 30th, the World Health Organization 
      declared the coronavirus outbreak as a Global Public Health Emergency. Although 
      Remdesivir and Molnupiravir are FDA-approved drugs for COVID-19, finding new 
      efficient and low-cost antiviral drugs against COVID-19 for applying in more 
      countries can still be helpful. One of the potential sources for finding new and 
      low-cost drugs is the herbal compounds in addition to repurposing FDA-approved 
      drugs. So, in this study, we focused on finding effective drug candidates against 
      COVID-19 based on the computational approaches. As ACE2 serves as a critical 
      receptor for cell entry of this virus. Inhibiting the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 
      on human ACE2 provides a promising therapeutic approach for developing drugs 
      against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we applied a bioinformatics approach to identify 
      possible potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. A library of FDA-approved compounds 
      and five natural compounds was screened using Smina docking. Top-docking 
      compounds are then applied in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to assess the 
      stability of ACE2-inhibitor complexes. Results indicate that Luteolin and Chrysin 
      represent high conformation stability with ACE2 during 120 ns of Molecular 
      Dynamics simulation. The binding free energies of Luteolin and Chrysin were 
      calculated by the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area method 
      (MM/PBSA) which confirmed the relative binding free energy of these drugs to ACE2 
      in favor of the effective binding. So, Luteolin and Chrysin could sufficiently 
      interact with ACE2 and block the Spike binding pocket of ACE2 and can be a 
      potential inhibitor against the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptor which is 
      an early stage of infection. Luteolin and Chrysin could be suggestive as 
      beneficial compounds for preventing or reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and 
      infection which need experimental work to prove.

AB  - Experiments with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are 
      limited by the need for biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions. A SARS-CoV-2 
      replicon system rather than an in vitro infection system is suitable for 
      antiviral screening since it can be handled under BSL2 conditions and does not 
      produce infectious particles. However, the reported replicon systems are 
      cumbersome because of the need for transient transfection in each assay. In this 
      study, we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome vector (the replicon-BAC 
      vector) including the SARS-CoV-2 replicon and a fusion gene encoding Renilla 
      luciferase and neomycin phosphotransferase II, examined the antiviral effects of 
      several known compounds, and then established a cell line stably harboring the 
      replicon-BAC vector. Several cell lines transiently transfected with the 
      replicon-BAC vector produced subgenomic replicon RNAs (sgRNAs) and viral 
      proteins, and exhibited luciferase activity. In the transient replicon system, 
      treatment with remdesivir or interferon-β but not with camostat or favipiravir 
      suppressed the production of viral agents and luciferase, indicating that 
      luciferase activity corresponds to viral replication. VeroE6/Rep3, a stable 
      replicon cell line based on VeroE6 cells, was successfully established and 
      continuously produced viral proteins, sgRNAs and luciferase, and their production 
      was suppressed by treatment with remdesivir or interferon-β. Molnupiravir, a 
      novel coronavirus RdRp inhibitor, inhibited viral replication more potently in 
      VeroE6/Rep3 cells than in VeroE6-based transient replicon cells. In summary, our 
      stable replicon system will be a powerful tool for the identification of 
      SARS-CoV-2 antivirals through high-throughput screening.

TI  - Management of SARS-CoV-2 infection: recommendations of the Polish Association of 
      Epidemiologists and Infectiologists as of February 23, 2022.

LID - 10.20452/pamw.16230 [doi]
AB  - The first Polish recommendations regarding the management of patients with 
      COVID-19 were published by the Polish Society of Epidemiologists and 
      Infectiologists (PTEiLChZ) on March 31, 2020, and the last annex was dated 
      November 12, 2021. The ongoing state of pandemic, the emergence of new variants 
      of the virus, and the availability of new drugs necessitate their updating. 
      Changes introduced in the current version of recommendations for the management 
      of COVID-19 comprised the possibility of using remedesivir in an outpatient 
      setting, previously reserved for inpatient treatment, as well as other antiviral 
      drugs-molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir / ritonavir. We revised the possibility of 
      using monoclonal antibodies due to the resistance of the currently dominant 
      Omicron variant. Anakinra, an antagonist of interleukin 1 receptors, has been 
      added as a treatment option in advanced stages of the disease, and the 
      recommended daily dose of glucocorticosteroids used in the most severe forms of 
      COVID-19 has been increased. Information on vaccination and pre-exposure 
      prophylaxis in specific populations has also been updated.

AB  - Massive usage of antiviral compounds during a pandemic creates an ideal ground 
      for emergence of resistant strains. Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of the 
      viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), was extensively prescribed under 
      emergency use authorization during the first 18 months of the COVID19 pandemic, 
      before randomized controlled trials showed poor efficacy in hospitalized 
      patients. RdRp mutations conferring resistance to remdesivir are well known from 
      in vitro studies, and the huge SARS-CoV-2 sequencing effort during the ongoing 
      COVID19 pandemic represents an unprecedented opportunity to assess emergence and 
      fitness of antiviral resistance in vivo. We mined the GISAID database to 
      extrapolate the frequency of remdesivir escape mutations. Our analysis reveals 
      very low levels of remdesivir resistance worldwide despite massive usage.

      SARS-CoV-2: A Modeling and Simulation Study.
PG  - 816429

LID - 816429
AB  - As of October 2021, neither established agents (e.g., hydroxychloroquine) nor 
      experimental drugs have lived up to their initial promise as antiviral treatment 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection. While vaccines are being globally deployed, 
      variants of concern (VOCs) are emerging with the potential for vaccine escape. 
      VOCs are characterized by a higher within-host transmissibility, and this may 
      alter their susceptibility to antiviral treatment. Here we describe a model to 
      understand the effect of changes in within-host reproduction number R(0), as 
      proxy for transmissibility, of VOCs on the effectiveness of antiviral therapy 
      with molnupiravir through modeling and simulation. Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801 or MK 
      4482) is an orally bioavailable antiviral drug inhibiting viral replication 
      through lethal mutagenesis, ultimately leading to viral extinction. We simulated 
      800 mg molnupiravir treatment every 12 h for 5 days, with treatment initiated at 
      different time points before and after infection. Modeled viral mutations range 
      from 1.25 to 2-fold greater transmissibility than wild type, but also include 
      putative co-adapted variants with lower transmissibility (0.75-fold). Antiviral 
      efficacy was correlated with R(0), making highly transmissible VOCs more 
      sensitive to antiviral therapy. Total viral load was reduced by up to 70% in 
      highly transmissible variants compared to 30% in wild type if treatment was 
      started in the first 1-3 days post inoculation. Less transmissible variants 
      appear less susceptible. Our findings suggest there may be a role for pre- or 
      post-exposure prophylactic antiviral treatment in areas with presence of highly 
      transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, clinical trials with borderline 
      efficacious results should consider identifying VOCs and examine their impact in 
      post-hoc analysis.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains uncontrolled despite the 
      rapid rollout of safe and effective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, underscoring the need to develop highly effective 
      antivirals. In the setting of waning immunity from infection and vaccination, 
      breakthrough infections are becoming increasingly common and treatment options 
      remain limited. Additionally, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, 
      with their potential to escape neutralization by therapeutic monoclonal 
      antibodies, emphasizes the need to develop second-generation oral antivirals 
      targeting highly conserved viral proteins that can be rapidly deployed to 
      outpatients. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro antiviral activity and in vivo 
      therapeutic efficacy of GS-621763, an orally bioavailable prodrug of GS-441524, 
      the parent nucleoside of remdesivir, which targets the highly conserved virus 
      RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. GS-621763 exhibited antiviral activity against 
      SARS-CoV-2 in lung cell lines and two different human primary lung cell culture 
      systems. GS-621763 was also potently antiviral against a genetically unrelated 
      emerging coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). The 
      dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile observed after oral administration of 
      GS-621763 translated to dose-dependent antiviral activity in mice infected with 
      SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic GS-621763 administration reduced viral load and lung 
      pathology; treatment also improved pulmonary function in COVID-19 mouse model. A 
      direct comparison of GS-621763 with molnupiravir, an oral nucleoside analog 
      antiviral which has recently received EUA approval, proved both drugs to be 
      similarly efficacious in mice. These data support the exploration of GS-441524 
      oral prodrugs for the treatment of COVID-19.
