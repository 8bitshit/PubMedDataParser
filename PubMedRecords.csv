34968008,Molnupiravir: A new candidate for COVID-19 treatment.,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in late December 2019 in china and has rapidly spread to many countries around the world. The effective pharmacotherapy can reduce the mortality of COVID-19. Antiviral medications are the candidate therapies for the management of COVID-19. Molnupiravir is an antiviral drug with anti-RNA polymerase activity and currently is under investigation for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. This review focuses on summarizing published literature for the mechanism of action, safety, efficacy, and clinical trials of molnupiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients."
34914868,Molnupiravir for Oral Treatment of Covid-19 in Nonhospitalized Patients.,"BACKGROUND: New treatments are needed to reduce the risk of progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Molnupiravir is an oral, small-molecule antiviral prodrug that is active against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with molnupiravir started within 5 days after the onset of signs or symptoms in nonhospitalized, unvaccinated adults with mild-to-moderate, laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and at least one risk factor for severe Covid-19 illness. Participants in the trial were randomly assigned to receive 800 mg of molnupiravir or placebo twice daily for 5 days. The primary efficacy end point was the incidence hospitalization or death at day 29; the incidence of adverse events was the primary safety end point. A planned interim analysis was performed when 50% of 1550 participants (target enrollment) had been followed through day 29. RESULTS: A total of 1433 participants underwent randomization; 716 were assigned to receive molnupiravir and 717 to receive placebo. With the exception of an imbalance in sex, baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. The superiority of molnupiravir was demonstrated at the interim analysis; the risk of hospitalization for any cause or death through day 29 was lower with molnupiravir (28 of 385 participants [7.3%]) than with placebo (53 of 377 [14.1%]) (difference, -6.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -11.3 to -2.4; P = 0.001). In the analysis of all participants who had undergone randomization, the percentage of participants who were hospitalized or died through day 29 was lower in the molnupiravir group than in the placebo group (6.8% [48 of 709] vs. 9.7% [68 of 699]; difference, -3.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -5.9 to -0.1). Results of subgroup analyses were largely consistent with these overall results; in some subgroups, such as patients with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, those with low baseline viral load, and those with diabetes, the point estimate for the difference favored placebo. One death was reported in the molnupiravir group and 9 were reported in the placebo group through day 29. Adverse events were reported in 216 of 710 participants (30.4%) in the molnupiravir group and 231 of 701 (33.0%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death in at-risk, unvaccinated adults with Covid-19.

35118917,"Efficacy and safety of three new oral antiviral treatment (molnupiravir, fluvoxamine and Paxlovid) for COVID-19：a meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic has not been completely controlled. Although great achievements have been made in COVID-19 research and many antiviral drugs have shown good therapeutic effects against COVID-19, a simple oral antiviral drug for COVID-19 has not yet been developed. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the improvement in mortality or hospitalization rates and adverse events among COVID-19 patients with three new oral antivirals (including molnupiravir, fluvoxamine and Paxlovid). METHODS: We searched scientific and medical databases, such as PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library for relevant articles and screened the references of retrieved studies on COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of eight studies were included in this study. The drug group included 2440 COVID-19 patients, including 54 patients who died or were hospitalized. The control group included a total of 2348 COVID-19 patients, including 118 patients who died or were hospitalized. The overall odds ratio (OR) of mortality or hospitalization was 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.49) for COVID-19 patients in the drug group and placebo group, indicating that oral antiviral drugs were effective for COVID-19 patients and reduced the mortality or hospitalization by approximately 67%. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that three novel oral antivirals (molnupiravir, fluvoxamine and Paxlovid) are effective in reducing the mortality and hospitalization rates in patients with COVID-19. In addition, the three oral drugs did not increase the occurrence of adverse events, thus exhibiting good overall safety. These three oral antiviral drugs are still being studied, and the available data suggest that they will bring new hope for COVID-19 recovery and have the potential to be a breakthrough and very promising treatment for COVID-19.KEY MESSAGESMany antiviral drugs have shown good therapeutic effects, and there is no simple oral antiviral drug for COVID-19 patients.Meta-analysis was conducted for three new oral antivirals to evaluate the improvement in mortality or hospitalization rates and adverse events among COVID-19 patients.We focussed on three new oral Coronavirus agents (molnupiravir, fluvoxamine and Paxlovid) and hope to provide guidance for the roll-out of oral antivirals."
34902743,RdRp inhibitors and COVID-19: Is molnupiravir a good option?,"Rapid changes in the viral genome allow viruses to evade threats posed by the host immune response or antiviral drugs, and can lead to viral persistence in the host cells. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an essential enzyme in RNA viruses, which is involved in RNA synthesis through the formation of phosphodiester bonds. Therefore, in RNA viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2, RdRp could be a crucial therapeutic target. The present review discusses the promising application of RdRp inhibitors, previously approved or currently being tested in human clinical trials, in the treatment of RNA virus infections. Nucleoside inhibitors (NIs) bind to the active site of RdRp, while nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) bind to allosteric sites. Given the absence of highly effective drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, the discovery of an efficient treatment for this pandemic is an urgent concern for researchers around the world. We review the evidence for molnupiravir (MK-4482, EIDD-2801), an antiviral drug originally designed for Alphavirus infections, as a potential preventive and therapeutic agent for the management of COVID-19. At the beginning of this pandemic, molnupiravir was in preclinical development for seasonal influenza. When COVID-19 spread dramatically, the timeline for development was accelerated to focus on the treatment of this pandemic. Real time consultation with regulators took place to expedite this program. We summarize the therapeutic potential of RdRp inhibitors, and highlight molnupiravir as a new small molecule drug for COVID-19 treatment."
35245942,Molnupiravir and Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir: Oral COVID Antiviral Drugs.,"At a crucial time with rapid spread of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 virus variant globally, the United States Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorization for two oral antivirals molnupiravir (>18 years) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) (≥12 years; >40kg ) for the outpatient treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 patients who are at risk for progression. Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue, whereas nirmatrelvir is a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor, and ritonavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor. Drug interactions are a major concern for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir demonstrated a greater risk reduction in hospitalization and death than molnupiravir compared to placebo. Both drugs need to be started within five days of symptoms onset and given for five days duration. This article will review the two oral COVID-19 antiviral drugs including the mechanisms of action, antiviral activity, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, clinical experience including trials, adverse events, recommended indications, and formulary considerations."
35444647,Molnupiravir and Its Antiviral Activity Against COVID-19.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) constitutes a major worldwide public health threat and economic burden. The pandemic is still ongoing and the SARS-CoV-2 variants are still emerging constantly, resulting in an urgent demand for new drugs to treat this disease. Molnupiravir, a biological prodrug of NHC (β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine), is a novel nucleoside analogue with a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Ebola virus (EBOV). Molnupiravir showed potent therapeutic and prophylactic activity against multiple coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV in animal models. In clinical trials, molnupiravir showed beneficial effects for mild to moderate COVID-19 patients with a favorable safety profile. The oral bioavailability and potent antiviral activity of molnupiravir highlight its potential utility as a therapeutic candidate against COVID-19. This review presents the research progress of molnupiravir starting with its discovery and synthesis, broad-spectrum antiviral effects, and antiviral mechanism. In addition, the preclinical studies, antiviral resistance, clinical trials, safety, and drug tolerability of molnupiravir are also summarized and discussed, aiming to expand our knowledge on molnupiravir and better deal with the COVID-19 epidemic."
34894208,Pharmacological treatment of COVID-19: an opinion paper.,"The precocity and efficacy of the vaccines developed so far against COVID-19 has been the most significant and saving advance against the pandemic. The development of vaccines has not prevented, during the whole period of the pandemic, the constant search for therapeutic medicines, both among existing drugs with different indications and in the development of new drugs. The Scientific Committee of the COVID-19 of the Illustrious College of Physicians of Madrid wanted to offer an early, simplified and critical approach to these new drugs, to new developments in immunotherapy and to what has been learned from the immune response modulators already known and which have proven effective against the virus, in order to help understand the current situation."
34941423,A phase 2a clinical trial of molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19 shows accelerated SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and elimination of infectious virus.,"There is an urgent need for an effective, oral, direct-acting therapeutic to block transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and prevent progression to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In a phase 2a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and antiviral efficacy of the nucleoside analog molnupiravir in 202 unvaccinated participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptom duration <7 days. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive molnupiravir (200 mg) or placebo and then 3:1 to receive molnupiravir (400 or 800 mg) or placebo, orally twice daily for 5 days. Antiviral activity was assessed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs. Infectious virus was assessed by inoculation of cultured Vero cells with samples from nasopharyngeal swabs and was detected by RT-PCR. Time to viral RNA clearance (primary endpoint) was decreased in the 800-mg molnupiravir group (median 14 days) compared to the placebo group (median 15 days) (log rank P value = 0.013). Of participants receiving 800 mg of molnupiravir, 92.5% achieved viral RNA clearance compared with 80.3% of placebo recipients by study end (4 weeks). Infectious virus (secondary endpoint) was detected in swabs from 1.9% of the 800-mg molnupiravir group compared with 16.7% of the placebo group at day 3 of treatment (P = 0.016). At day 5 of treatment, infectious virus was not isolated from any participants receiving 400 or 800 mg of molnupiravir compared with 11.1% of placebo recipients (P = 0.034 and 0.027, respectively). Molnupiravir was well tolerated across all doses."

35287311,Antiviral activity of molnupiravir against COVID-19: a schematic review of evidences.,"BACKGROUND: The study was aimed at encapsulating the evidence of in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities of molnupiravir and its active form against highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen responsible for COVID-19, and finding out the efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in clinical trials. MAIN BODY: Information on publications was explored on several databases, gray literature was reviewed, and the outcomes were discussed narratively. Molnupiravir's antiviral efficacy and associated mechanism of action have been verified in vitro against both non-COVID and multiple coronaviruses. Molnupiravir has been tried in preclinical investigations in numerous animal models against non-coronaviruses. Clinical studies in several countries are now being conducted to evaluate its antiviral efficacy in persons infected with COVID-19. The medication displays antiviral effect via generation of copying mistakes during viral RNA replication. CONCLUSIONS: Molnupiravir is the first oral antiviral medicine to show considerable and convincing antiviral activity in vitro and in animal models. Molnupiravir stops the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in animals that have been infected and in cells grown in a lab. In a clinical research, early molnupiravir treatment reduced hospitalization and death risk in unvaccinated individuals with COVID-19. In the battle against SARS-CoV-2, it could be a potent weapon. However, its role in COVID-19 in moderate to severe cases is still up in the air, and more research is needed."
35199608,Comprehensive review on molnupiravir in COVID-19: a novel promising antiviral to combat the pandemic.,"Despite the progress in the management of COVID-19, effective oral antiviral agents are still lacking. In the present review, the potential beneficial effects of molnupiravir in the management of COVID-19 are discussed. A literature search in Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov for the relevant articles regarding the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical trials of molnupiravir in the management of COVID-19 is conducted. Most of the preclinical studies and available clinical trials showed a favorable short-term safety profile of molnupiravir; however, given its possible genotoxic effects, further trials are required to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19."

35051686,An updated practical guideline on use of molnupiravir and comparison with agents having emergency use authorization for treatment of COVID-19.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Molnupiravir is a newer oral antiviral drug that has recently received emergency use authorization (EUA) in USA, UK and India. We aim to conduct an update on our previous systematic review to provide practical clinical guideline for using molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched the electronic database of PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar until January 5, 2022, using key MeSH keywords. RESULTS: Final result of phase 3 study in 1433 non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed a significant reduction in composite risk of hospital admission or death (absolute risk difference, -3.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, -5.9 to -0.1%]; 1-sided P = 0.02) although with a non-significant 31% relative risk reduction (RRR). RRR for death alone was 89% (95% CI, 14 to 99; P-value not reported). Number needed to treat to prevent 1 death or 1 hospitalization or death composite appears to be closely competitive to other agents having EUA in people with COVID-19. However, cost-wise molnupiravir is comparatively cheaper compared to all other agents. CONCLUSION: Molnupiravir could be a useful agent in non-pregnant unvaccinated adults with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of severity including hospitalization. However, it is effective only when used within 5-days of onset of symptoms. A 5-days course seems to be safe without any obvious short-term side effects."

35138784,Molnupiravir.,"Molnupiravir is a ribonucleoside analogue and antiviral agent that is used in the therapy the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) infection, the cause of the novel coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19). Molnupiravir therapy is given orally for 5 days early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and has not been linked to serum aminotransferase elevations or to clinically apparent liver injury."
35184266,Molnupiravir: First Approval.,"Molnupiravir (Lagevrio(®)) is an orally-administered antiviral prodrug that inhibits replication of RNA viruses through viral error induction. It is being developed by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics for the prevention and treatment of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Molnupiravir received its first approval on 4 November 2021 in the UK for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostic test and who have at least one risk factor for developing severe illness. Molnupiravir is filed for approval and has emergency use authorization for the treatment of COVID-19 in several countries, including the USA, Japan and those in the EU. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of molnupiravir leading to this first approval for COVID-19."
35458493,Antiviral Efficacy of Molnupiravir for COVID-19 Treatment.,"The ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19 poses unprecedented public health risks for governments and societies around the world, which have been exacerbated by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Pharmaceutical interventions with high antiviral efficacy are expected to delay and contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Molnupiravir, as an oral antiviral prodrug, is active against SARS-CoV-2 and is now (23 February 2022) one of the seven widely-used coronavirus treatments. To estimate its antiviral efficacy of Molnupiravir, we built a granular mathematical within-host model. We find that the antiviral efficacy of Molnupiravir to stop the growth of the virus is 0.56 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.64), which could inhibit 56% of the replication of infected cells per day. There has been good progress in developing high-efficacy antiviral drugs that rapidly reduce viral load and may also reduce the infectiousness of treated cases if administered as early as possible."
35002192,Review on molnupiravir as a promising oral drug for the treatment of COVID-19.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, various drug candidates have been developed, molnupiravir (MK-4482 and EIDD-2801), which is a new orally anti-viral agent under development for the treatment of COVID-19, is under study in the final stage of the clinical trial. Molnupiravir enhances the replication of viral RNA mutations in animals and humans. Due to the high demand for the synthesis of this drug, it was essential to develop an efficient and suitable synthetic pathway from raw material. In this study, molecular docking analysis on molnupiravir is examined also, the mechanism of action (MOA) and the recent synthetic pathway is reported. This review will be helpful to different disciplines such as medicinal chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and pharmacology."

VeroE6-GFP cells were pre-treated overnight with serial dilutions of the compounds before infection. The GFP signal was determined by high-content imaging on day 4 post-infection. All molecules have equipotent antiviral activity against the ancestral virus and the VOCs Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. These findings are in line with the observation that the target proteins of these antivirals (respectively the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase and the viral main protease Mpro) are highly conserved."

34972812,Editorial: Current Status of Oral Antiviral Drug Treatments for SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Non-Hospitalized Patients.,"On 4th November 2021, the first oral antiviral drug for COVID-19, molnupiravir (Lagevrio®), received full regulatory approval from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK. Molnupiravir is an orally bioavailable antiviral drug for use at home when a SARS-CoV-2 test is positive. On 22nd December 2022, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the oral antiviral drug, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) for adults and children with mild and moderate COVID-19 at increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19. These regulatory drug approvals come at a crucial time when new variants of concern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are spreading rapidly. Although the FDA approved remdesivir (Veklury®) on 22nd October 2020 for use in adults and children for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, its use has been limited by the requirement for intravenous administration in a healthcare facility. The four FDA-approved therapeutic neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, imdevimab, bamlanivimab, etesevimab, and casirivimab are costly and also require medically-supervised intravenous administration. The availability of effective, low-cost oral antiviral drugs available in a community setting that can be used at an early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection is now a priority in controlling COVID-19. An increasing number of repurposed antiviral drugs are currently under investigation or in the early stages of regulatory approval. This Editorial aims to present an update on the current status of orally bioavailable antiviral drug treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection."

35233565,Characterization and antiviral susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron/BA.2.,"The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants possessing large numbers of mutations has raised concerns of decreased effectiveness of current vaccines, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, and antiviral drugs for COVID-19 against these variants1,2. While the original Omicron lineage, BA.1, has become dominant in many countries, BA.2 has been detected in at least 67 countries and has become dominant in the Philippines, India, and Denmark. Here, we evaluated the replicative ability and pathogenicity of an authentic infectious BA.2 isolate in immunocompetent and human ACE2 (hACE2)-expressing mice and hamsters. In contrast to recent data with chimeric, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 strains expressing the spike proteins of BA.1 and BA.2 on an ancestral WK-521 backbone3, we observed similar infectivity and pathogenicity in mice and hamsters between BA.2 and BA.1, and less pathogenicity compared to early SARS-CoV-2 strains. We also observed a marked and significant reduction in the neutralizing activity of plasma from COVID-19 convalescent individuals and vaccine recipients against BA.2 compared to ancestral and Delta variant strains. In addition, we found that some therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (REGN10987/REGN10933, COV2-2196/COV2-2130, and S309) and antiviral drugs (molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir, and S-217622) can restrict viral infection in the respiratory organs of hamsters infected with BA.2. These findings suggest that the replication and pathogenicity of BA.2 is comparable to that of BA.1 in rodents and that several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and antiviral compounds are effective against Omicron/BA.2 variants."

The specific antiviral drug for this new infection is still under research. Some new antiviral drugs, including molnupiravir and favipiravir, are proposed for usefulness in management of COVID-19. Additionally, some classic antiviral drugs used for other viral infections are also reproposed for the potentials for management of COVID-19. In the management of COVID-19, there are several pharmacological actions. An important consideration in antiviral therapy is the management of oxidative stress, which plays important roles in viral infections including to COVID-19. The analysis of antioxidative properties of alternative drugs for management of COVID-19 is interesting and can give basic data for further new antiviral drug researching. Here, the authors perform a molecular analysis on molnupiravir, favipiravir and other antiviral drugs with proposed potentials for management of COVID-19 to determine their antioxidative properties. Data from electron acceptor and donor calculation for each drug is used for further estimating overall antioxidative characteristic. Based on the present study, all studied drugs have overall antioxidative properties. Hence, the advantage of molnupiravir, favipiravir and other antiviral drugs with proposed potentials for the management of COVID-19 is their direct action on viral molecule via binding-blocking process as well as antixodiative process. For management of COVID-19 antioxidative stress, other non-antiviral drugs that are proposed for clinical advantage might also be useful."
35287313,The pill of recovery; Molnupiravir for treatment of COVID-19 patients; a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Throughout the time of the global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus, there has been a compelling necessity for the development of effective antiviral agents and prophylactic vaccines to limit the virus spread, disease burden, hospitalization, and mortality. Until mid of 2021, the NIH treatment guideline declared no single oral therapy proven to treat mild to moderate cases. A new hope arose when a repurposed direct acting oral anti-viral agent ""Molnupiravir"" was shown to be effective in decreasing mortality and need for hospitalization in mild to moderate cases with relatively good safety profile; exhibiting a significant reduction in virus titers only after two days from administration. Molnupiravir recently granted the FDA emergency use authorization to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 patients with at least one risk factor for progression. METHODS: We performed a computer-based literature search of (PubMed, Science direct, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, Cochrane COVID study register, EU registry, Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI)) till February 15(th), 2022. The following keywords were used in our search (""Molnupiravir "" or ""NHC"" or ""EIDD-2807"" or ""MK-4482"" or ""EIDD-1931""). RESULTS: We identified from the initial search a total of 279 articles; 246 articles (BioRxiv and MedRxiv N=186, PubMed N=33, Science direct N=27) and 33 Clinical trials from the following registries (ISCTRN (N=1), Clinical trials.gov (N=6), CTRI (N=12), Cochrane (N=14)).Through screening phases, 21 records were removed as duplicates and 198 irrelevant records were also excluded. The included studies in this systematic review were (N=60) included 39 published papers and 21 clinical trials. After Manual addition (N=4), the qualitative assessment included (N=64).

The DFT calculations were performed to verify the structure of these tautomers, as well as their electronic and optical properties. Molecular docking was applied to examine the influence of the structures of the keto-oxime, keto-hydroxylamine and hydroxyl-oxime tautomers on a series of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

35169793,SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern type and biological sex affect efficacy of molnupiravir in dwarf hamster model of severe COVID-19.,"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) have triggered distinct infection waves in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, culminating in currently all-time high incidence rates of VOC omicron. Orally available direct-acting antivirals such as molnupiravir promise to improve disease management and limit SARS-CoV-2 spread. However, molnupiravir efficacy against VOC delta was questioned based on clinical trial results and its potency against omicron is unknown. This study evaluates molnupiravir against a panel of relevant VOC in three efficacy models: primary human airway epithelium organoids, the ferret model of upper respiratory disease, and a lethal Roborovski dwarf hamster efficacy model of severe COVID-19-like acute lung injury. All VOC were equally efficiently inhibited by molnupiravir in cultured cells and organoids. Treatment consistently reduced upper respiratory VOC shedding in ferrets and prevented viral transmission. Pathogenicity in the dwarf hamsters was VOC-dependent and highest for gamma, omicron, and delta with fulminant lung histopathology. Oral molnupiravir started 12 hours after infection resulted in complete survival of treated dwarf hamsters independent of challenge VOC. However, reduction in lung virus differed VOC-dependently, ranging from one (delta) to four (gamma) orders of magnitude compared to vehicle-treated animals. Dwarf hamsters infected with VOC omicron showed significant individual variation in response to treatment. Virus load reduction was significant in treated males, but not females. The dwarf hamster model recapitulates mixed efficacy of molnupiravir seen in human trials and alerts that therapeutic benefit of approved antivirals must be continuously reassessed in vivo as new VOC emerge."
35104837,Altered TMPRSS2 usage by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron impacts infectivity and fusogenicity.,"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant emerged in 2021(1) and has multiple mutations in its spike protein(2). Here we show that the spike protein of Omicron has a higher affinity for ACE2 compared with Delta, and a marked change in its antigenicity increases Omicron's evasion of therapeutic monoclonal and vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralizing antibodies after two doses. mRNA vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and broadens neutralization. Importantly, the antiviral drugs remdesivir and molnupiravir retain efficacy against Omicron BA.1. Replication was similar for Omicron and Delta virus isolates in human nasal epithelial cultures. However, in lung cells and gut cells, Omicron demonstrated lower replication. Omicron spike protein was less efficiently cleaved compared with Delta. The differences in replication were mapped to the entry efficiency of the virus on the basis of spike-pseudotyped virus assays. The defect in entry of Omicron pseudotyped virus to specific cell types effectively correlated with higher cellular RNA expression of TMPRSS2, and deletion of TMPRSS2 affected Delta entry to a greater extent than Omicron. Furthermore, drug inhibitors targeting specific entry pathways(3) demonstrated that the Omicron spike inefficiently uses the cellular protease TMPRSS2, which promotes cell entry through plasma membrane fusion, with greater dependency on cell entry through the endocytic pathway. Consistent with suboptimal S1/S2 cleavage and inability to use TMPRSS2, syncytium formation by the Omicron spike was substantially impaired compared with the Delta spike. The less efficient spike cleavage of Omicron at S1/S2 is associated with a shift in cellular tropism away from TMPRSS2-expressing cells, with implications for altered pathogenesis."

35315098,Molnupiravir: A lethal mutagenic drug against rapidly mutating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-A narrative review.,"Broad-spectrum antiviral agents targeting viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are expected to be a key therapeutic strategy in the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its future variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analog that in vivo experiments have been reported to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Clinical trials of molnupiravir as a therapy for patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 also suggest its significant therapeutic efficacy in comparison to placebo. Molnupiravir is lethally mutagenic against viral RNA, but its effect on host cell DNA is being questioned. Herein, the safety concerns of molnupiravir are discussed with recent findings from published reports and clinical trials. The unchanged efficacy of molnupiravir against mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants is also highlighted. With its administration via the oral route, molnupiravir is expected to turn the tide of the COVID-19 pandemic."
35367622,COVID-19 and the promise of small molecule therapeutics: Are there lessons to be learnt?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had grounded the world to a standstill. As the disease continues to rage two years on, it is apparent that effective therapeutics are critical for a successful endemic living with COVID-19. A dearth in suitable antivirals has prompted researchers and healthcare professionals to investigate existing and developmental drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although some of these drugs initially appeared to be promising for the treatment of COVID-19, they were ultimately found to be ineffective. In this review, we provide a retrospective analysis on the merits and limitations of some of these drugs that were tested against SARS-CoV-2 as well as those used for adjuvant therapy. While many of these drugs are no longer part of our arsenal for the treatment of COVID-19, important lessons can be learnt. The recent inclusion of molnupiravir and Paxlovid™ as treatment options for COVID-19 represent our best hope to date for endemic living with COVID-19. Our viewpoints on these two drugs and their prospects as current and future antiviral agents will also be provided."
35358570,Molnupiravir; molecular and functional descriptors of mitochondrial safety.,"Molnupiravir is an orally active nucleoside analog antiviral drug that recently was approved by the U.S. FDA for emergency treatment of adult patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus and at risk for severe progression. The active form of the drug, N-hydroxycytidine (NHC) triphosphate competes for incorporation by RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) into the replicating viral genome resulting in mutations and arrest of the replicating virus. Historically, some nucleoside analog antiviral drugs have been found to lack specificity for the virus and also inhibit replication and/or expression of the mitochondrial genome. The objective of the present study was to test whether molnupiravir and/or NHC also target mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (PolG) or RNA polymerase (POLRMT) activity to inhibit the replication and/or expression of the mitochondrial genome leading to impaired mitochondrial function. Human-derived HepG2 cells were exposed for 48 h in culture to increasing concentrations of either molnupiravir or NHC after which cytotoxicity, mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial gene expression were determined. The phenotypic endpoint, mitochondrial respiration, was measured with the Seahorse® XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Both molnupiravir and NHC were cytotoxic at concentrations of ≥10 μM. However, at non-cytotoxic concentrations, neither significantly altered mitochondrial gene dose or transcription, or mitochondrial respiration. From this we conclude that mitochondrial toxicity is not a primary off target in the mechanism of cytotoxicity for either molnupiravir or its active metabolite NHC in the HepG2 cell line."
35427117,A Nanopore Based Molnupiravir Sensor.,"Nucleoside analogues are reagents that resemble the structure of natural nucleosides and are widely applied in antiviral and anticancer therapy. Molnupiravir, a recently reported nucleoside analogue drug, has shown its inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2. Rapid tracing of molnupiravir and its metabolites is important in the evaluation of its pharmacology effect, but direct sensing of molnupiravir as a single molecule has not been reported to date. Here, we demonstrate a nanopore-based sensor with which direct sensing of molnupiravir and its two major metabolites β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine and its triphosphate can be achieved simultaneously. In conjunction with a custom machine learning algorithm, an accuracy of 92% was achieved. This sensing strategy may be useful in the current pandemic and is in principle suitable for other nucleoside analogue drugs."
35276385,A stability indicating RP-HPLC method for determination of the COVID-19 drug molnupiravir applied using nanoformulations in permeability studies.,"Antiviral drugs have gained much more attention in recent years due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and many drug candidates are currently under investigation in order to end pandemic. Molnupiravir, a prodrug of the synthetic nucleoside derivative N4-hydroxycytidine, is one of the promising candidates for SARS-CoV-2 treatment. In this study, a RP-HPLC method was developed for the determination of Molnupiravir and applied for in vitro permeability studies of self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) formulations using Caco-2 cell line. Discovery® HS C18 Column (75 ×4.6 mm, 3 µm) was used at 30 °C. Isocratic elution was performed with ACN:water (20:80 v/v) mixture. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min and UV detection was at 240 nm. Molnupiravir eluted within 5 min. Molnupiravir was exposed to thermal, photolytic, hydrolytic, and oxidative stress conditions. Peak homogeneity data of Molnupiravir in the stressed samples peak obtained using photodiode array detector, in the stressed sample chromatograms, demonstrated the specificity of the method for their estimation in presence of degradants. The developed method was validated according to the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines and found to be linear within the range 0.1-60.0 μg/mL. The method was simple, rapid, selective, sensitive, accurate, precise, robust and rugged. Thus, it was applied successfully for permeability quantitation of Molnupiravir in nanoformulations. The apparent permeability of Molnupiravir in SEDDS formulations, which have droplet size under 350 nm, was calculated as 3.20 ± 0.44 × 10(-6) cm/s."

Here we report a concise biocatalytic process for Molnupiravir, a nucleoside analogue recently approved as an orally available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Key to the success of this process was the development of an efficient biocatalyst for the production of N-hydroxy-cytidine through evolutionary adaption of the hydrolytic enzyme cytidine deaminase. This engineered biocatalyst performs >85 000 turnovers in less than 3 h, operates at 180 g/L substrate loading, and benefits from in situ crystallization of the N-hydroxy-cytidine product (85% yield), which can be converted to Molnupiravir by a selective 5'-acylation using Novozym 435."
35165657,Outpatient Therapies for COVID-19: How Do We Choose?,"BACKGROUND: Several outpatient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapies have reduced hospitalization in randomized controlled trials. The choice of therapy may depend on drug efficacy, toxicity, pricing, availability, and available infrastructure. To facilitate comparative decision-making, we evaluated the efficacy of each treatment in clinical trials and estimated the cost per hospitalization prevented. METHODS: Wherever possible, we obtained relative risk for hospitalization from published randomized controlled trials. Otherwise, we extracted data from press releases, conference abstracts, government submissions, or preprints. If there was >1 study, the results were meta-analyzed. Using relative risk, we estimated the number needed to treat (NNT), assuming a baseline hospitalization risk of 5%, and compared the cost per hospitalization prevented with the estimate for an average Medicare COVID-19 hospitalization ($21 752). Drug pricing was estimated from GoodRx, from government purchases, or manufacturer estimates. Administrative and societal costs were not included. Results will be updated online as new studies emerge and/or final numbers become available. RESULTS: At a 5% risk of hospitalization, the estimated NNT was 80 for fluvoxamine, 91 for colchicine, 72 for inhaled corticosteroids, 24 for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, 50 for molnupiravir, 28 for remdesivir, 25 for sotrovimab, 29 for casirivimab/imdevimab, and 29 for bamlanivimab/etesevimab. For drug cost per hospitalization prevented, colchicine, fluvoxamine, inhaled corticosteroids, and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were below the Medicare estimated hospitalization cost. CONCLUSIONS: Many countries are fortunate to have access to several effective outpatient therapies to prevent COVID-19 hospitalization. Given differences in efficacy, toxicity, cost, and administration complexity, this assessment serves as one means to frame treatment selection."
35233571,Molnupiravir (MK-4482) is efficacious against Omicron and other SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Syrian hamster COVID-19 model.,"The recent emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant of concern (VOC) containing a heavily mutated spike protein capable of escaping preexisting immunity, identifies a continued need for interventional measures. Molnupiravir (MK-4482), an orally administered nucleoside analog, has demonstrated efficacy against earlier SARS-CoV-2 lineages and was recently approved for SARS-CoV-2 infections in high-risk adults. Here we assessed the efficacy of MK-4482 against the earlier Alpha, Beta and Delta VOCs and Omicron in the Syrian hamster COVID-19 model. Omicron replication and associated lung disease in vehicle treated hamsters was reduced compared to the earlier VOCs. MK-4482 treatment inhibited virus replication in the lungs of Alpha, Beta and Delta VOC infected hamsters. Importantly, MK-4482 profoundly inhibited virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of hamsters infected with the Omicron VOC. Consistent with its mutagenic mechanism, MK-4482 treatment had a more pronounced inhibitory effect on infectious virus titers compared to viral RNA genome load. Histopathologic analysis showed that MK-4482 treatment caused a concomitant reduction in the level of lung disease and viral antigen load in infected hamsters across all VOCs examined. Together, our data indicate the potential of MK-4482 as an effective antiviral against known SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, especially Omicron, and likely future SARS-CoV-2 variants. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY: MK-4482 inhibits replication of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including Omicron, in the Syrian hamster COVID-19 model."

35073629,Oral antivirals for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Vaccines and antivirals are the classical weapons deployed to contain, prevent, and treat life-threatening viral illnesses. Specifically, for SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccines protect against severe COVID-19 disease manifestations and complications. However, waning immunity and emergence of vaccine escape mutants remains a growing threat. This is highlighted by the current surge of the omicron COVID-19 variant. Thus, there is a race to find treatment alternatives. We contend that oral small molecule antivirals that halt SARSCoV- 2 infection are essential. Compared to currently available monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir, where parenteral administration is required, oral antivirals offer treatments in an outpatient setting with dissemination available on a larger scale. In response to this need at 2021's end, regulatory agencies provided emergency use authorization for both molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir. These medicines act on the viral polymerase and protease, respectively. Each is given for 5 days and can reduce disease progression by 30% and 89%, respectively. The advent of additional oral antivirals, the assessment of combination therapies, the formulation of extended-release medications, and their benefit for both early treatment and prophylaxis will likely transform the landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic."
35299948,Cost of Goods Analysis Facilitates an Integrated Approach to Identifying Alternative Synthesis Methodologies for Lower Cost Manufacturing of the COVID-19 Antiviral Molnupiravir.,"Orally delivered drugs offer significant benefits in the fight against viral infections, and cost-effective production is critical to their impact on pandemic response in low- and middle-income countries. One example, molnupiravir, a COVID-19 therapy developed by Emory, Ridgeback, and Merck & Co., had potential to benefit from significant cost of goods (COGs) reductions for its active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), including starting materials. A holistic approach to identifying, developing, and evaluating optimized synthetic routes, which includes detailed COGs modeling, provides a rapid means to increase the availability, uptake and application of molnupiravir and other antivirals in global markets. Identification and development of alternate processes for the synthesis of molnupiravir has been conducted by the Medicines for All Institute at Virginia Commonwealth University (M4ALL) and the Green and Turner Labs at the University of Manchester. Both groups developed innovative processes based on synthetic route design and biocatalysis aimed at lowering costs and improving global access. The authors then performed COGs modeling to assess cost saving opportunities. This included a focus on manufacturing environments and facilities amenable to global public health and the identification of key parameters using sensitivity analyses. While all of the evaluated routes provide efficiency benefits, the best options yielded 3-6 fold API COGs reductions leading to treatment COGs as low as <$3/regimen. Additionally, key starting materials and cost drivers were quantified to evaluate the robustness of the savings. Finally, COGs models can continue to inform the focus of future development efforts on the most promising routes for additional cost savings. While the full price of a treatment course includes other factors, these alternative API synthetic approaches have significant potential to help facilitate broader access in low- and middle-income countries. As other promising therapeutics are developed, a similar process could enable rapid cost reductions while enhancing global access."
35233163,Can Panax ginseng help control cytokine storm in COVID-19?,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 are directly associated with hyper-activation of innate immune response that excessively produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce cytokine storm, leading to multi-organ-failure and significant morbidity/mortality. Currently, several antiviral drugs such as Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir) and molnupiravir are authorized to treat mild to moderate COVID-19, however, there are still no drugs that can specifically fight against challenges of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Panax ginseng, a medicinal plant widely used for treating various conditions, might be appropriate for this need due to its anti-inflammatory/cytokine/viral activities, fewer side effects, and cost efficiency. To review Panax ginseng and its pharmacologically active-ingredients as potential phytopharmaceuticals for treating cytokine storm of COVID-19, articles that reporting its positive effects on the cytokine production were searched from academic databases. Experimental/clinical evidences for the effectiveness of Panax ginseng and its active-ingredients in preventing or mitigating cytokine storm, especially for the cascade of cytokine storm, suggest that they might be beneficial as an adjunct treatment for cytokine storm of COVID-19. This review may provide a new approach to discover specific medications using Panax ginseng to control cytokine storm of COVID-19."

35185356,Insight into the biological impact of COVID-19 and its vaccines on human health.,"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) is a contagious illness that has been declared a global epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The coronavirus causes diseases ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory diseases and death. Coronavirus primarily affects blood pressure by attaching to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor. This virus has an impact on multiple organ systems, including the central nervous system, immune system, cardiovascular system, peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, endocrine system, urinary system, skin, and pregnancy. For the prevention of COVID-19, various vaccines such as viral-like particle vaccines, entire inactivated virus vaccines, viral vector vaccines, live attenuated virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, RNA vaccines, and DNA vaccines are now available. Some of the COVID-19 vaccines are reported to cause a variety of adverse effects that range from mild to severe in nature. SARS-CoV-2 replication is controlled by the RNA-Dependent RNA-Polymerase enzyme (RdRp). The availability of FDA-approved anti-RdRp drugs (Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir) as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that tightly bind to its RdRp may aid in the treatment of patients and reduce the risk of the mysterious new form of COVID-19 viral infection. RdRp inhibitors, such as remdesivir (an anti-Ebola virus experimental drug) and favipiravir (an anti-influenza drug), inhibit RdRp and thus slow the progression of COVID-19 and associated clinical symptoms, as well as significantly shorten recovery time. Molnupiravir, an orally active RdRp inhibitor and noval broad spectrum antiviral agent, is an isopropyl pro-drug of EIDD-1931 for emergency use. Galidesivir's in vitro and in vivo activities are limited to RNA of human public health concern. Top seeds for antiviral treatments with high potential to combat the SARS-CoV-2 strain include guanosine derivatives (IDX-184), setrobuvir, and YAK. The goal of this review is to compile scattered information on available COVID-19 vaccines and other treatments for protecting the human body from their harmful effects and to provide options for making better choices in a timely manner."

In vitro data indicate that molnupiravir may be 100 times more potent as an antiviral agent than ribavirin or favipiravir. Molnupiravir has recently demonstrated efficacy in a phase 3 clinical trial. Because of its anticipated global use, its relative potency, and the reported in vitro ""host"" cell mutagenicity of its active principle, β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine, we have reviewed the development of molnupiravir and its genotoxicity safety evaluation, as well as the genotoxicity profiles of three congeners, that is, ribavirin, favipiravir, and 5-(2-chloroethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine. We consider the potential genetic risks of molnupiravir on the basis of all available information and focus on the need for additional human genotoxicity data and follow-up in patients treated with molnupiravir and similar drugs. Such human data are especially relevant for antiviral NAs that have the potential of permanently modifying the genomes of treated patients and/or causing human teratogenicity or embryotoxicity. We conclude that the results of preclinical genotoxicity studies and phase 1 human clinical safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics are critical components of drug safety assessments and sentinels of unanticipated adverse health effects. We provide our rationale for performing more thorough genotoxicity testing prior to and within phase 1 clinical trials, including human PIG-A and error corrected next generation sequencing (duplex sequencing) studies in DNA and mitochondrial DNA of patients treated with antiviral NAs that induce genome error catastrophe via lethal mutagenesis."
35408729,Two Green Micellar HPLC and Mathematically Assisted UV Spectroscopic Methods for the Simultaneous Determination of Molnupiravir and Favipiravir as a Novel Combined COVID-19 Antiviral Regimen.,"Following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, a race was initiated to find a successful regimen for postinfections. Among those trials, a recent study declared the efficacy of an antiviral combination of favipiravir (FAV) and molnupiravir (MLP). The combined regimen helped in a successful 60% eradication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the lungs of studied hamster models. Moreover, it prevented viral transmission to cohosted sentinels. Because both medications are orally bioavailable, the coformulation of FAV and MLP can be predicted. The developed study is aimed at developing new green and simple methods for the simultaneous determination of FAV and MLP and then at their application in the study of their dissolution behavior if coformulated together. A green micellar HPLC method was validated using an RP-C18 core-shell column (5 μm, 150 × 4.6 mm) and an isocratic mixed micellar mobile phase composed of 0.1 M SDS, 0.01 M Brij-35, and 0.02 M monobasic potassium phosphate mixture and adjusted to pH 3.1 at 1.0 mL min(-1) flow rate. The analytes were detected at 230 nm. The run time was less than five minutes under the optimized chromatographic conditions. Four other multivariate chemometric model methods were developed and validated, namely, classical least square (CLS), principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS-1), and genetic algorithm-partial least squares (GA-PLS-1). The developed models succeeded in resolving the great similarity and overlapping in the FAV and MLP UV spectra unlike the traditional univariate methods. All methods were organic solvent-free, did not require extraction or derivatization steps, and were applied for the construction of the simultaneous dissolution profile for FAV tablets and MLP capsules. The methods revealed that the amount of the simultaneously released cited drugs increases up until reaching a plateau after 15 and 20 min for FAV and MLP, respectively. The greenness was assessed on GAPI and found to be in harmony with green analytical chemistry concepts."
35474908,Ayurvedic formulations: Potential COVID-19 therapeutics?,"BACKGROUND: While Molnupiravir and Paxlovid have recently been approved for use in some countries, there are no widely available treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herbal extracts have been used to treat respiratory clinical indications by Ayurvedic medicine practitioners with minimal adverse reactions and intense research efforts are currently under way to develop some of these formulations for COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: Literature search for in silico, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies on the topic of Ayurvedic formulations for potential COVID-19 treatment, in order to present the current state of current knowledge by integrating information across all systems. RESULTS: The search yielded 20 peer reviewed articles on in silico studies examining the interaction of phytoconstituents of popular Ayurvedic formulations with SARS-CoV-2 components and its receptors; five articles on preclinical investigations of the ability of selected Ayurvedic formulations to inhibit functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins; and 51 completed clinical trials on the efficacy of using Ayurvedic formulations for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. Clinical data was available from 17 of the 51 trials. There was a considerable overlap between formulations used in the in silico studies and the clinical trials. This finding was unexpected as there is no clearly stated alignment between studies and the traditional pathway to drug discovery- basic discovery leading to in vitro and in vivo proof of concept, followed by validation in clinical trials. This was further demonstrated in the majority of the in silico studies where focus was on potential antiviral mechanisms, while the clinical trials were focused on patient recovery using oral treatments. In all 17 clinical trials where data was available, Ayurvedic treatments lead to a shorter period to recovery in participants with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The most commonly used Ayurvedic treatments for management of respiratory symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection appear to have prophylactic and/or therapeutic properties. It would be of particular interest to assess synergistic and concomitant systemic effects and antiviral activities of individual phytoconstituents and their combinations in the Ayurvedic treatments."

A new oral therapeutic named molnupiravir has been promoted as providing an approximately 50% reduction in death or the need for hospitalization. The clinical trial evaluating this drug was stopped early at the recommendation of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board after approximately 50% of the sample had been recruited. At the point of discontinuing the trial, approximately 90% of the planned sample had been recruited and had available follow-up data accessible. We discuss issues about the study conduct, analysis, and interpretation, including 1) the authors and sponsors presented the interim analysis as the primary analysis; 2) communication between sponsors and the Data Safety and Monitoring Board was insufficient; 3) the treatment effects reverse when examining only the post-interim analysis population, and are substantially attenuated when examining the full data; 4) the choice of primary analysis is incorrect; 5) analysis of lost-to-follow-up patients favors the study drug; and 6) other known molnupiravir trials were not presented in the primary study findings. As a result of methodological and statistical concerns, it seems that external trials, separate from those supported by the sponsoring company, are required to determine the utility of this drug."

Aging, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, conditions with preexisting impaired endothelial functions predispose to COVID-19. While respiratory epithelium is the main route of virus entry, the endothelial cells (ECs) lining pulmonary blood vessels are also an integral part of lung injury in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 not only affects the lungs and respiratory system but also gastrointestinal (GI) tract, liver, pancreas, kidneys, heart, brain, and skin. Blood vessels are likely conduits for the virus dissemination to these distant organs. Importantly, ECs are also critical for vascular regeneration during injury/lesions healing and restoration of vascular network. The World Journal of Gastroenterology has published in last two years over 67 outstanding papers on COVID-19 infection with a focus on the GI tract, liver, pancreas, etc., however, the role of the endothelial and vascular components as major targets for COVID-19-induced tissue injury, spreading to various organs, and injury healing have not been sufficiently emphasized. In the present article, we focus on these subjects and on current treatments including the most recent oral drugs molnupiravir and paxlovid that show a dramatic, significant efficacy in controlling severe COVID-19 infection."

The development of novel effective antiviral drugs to fight against SARS-CoV-2 is a time cost. As a result, some specific FDA-approved drugs have already been repurposed and authorized for COVID-19 treatment. The repurposed drugs used were either antiviral or non-antiviral drugs. Accordingly, the present review thoroughly focuses on the repurposing efficacy of these drugs including clinical trials experienced, the combination therapies used, the novel methods followed for treatment, and their future perspective. Therefore, drug repurposing was regarded as an effective avenue for COVID-19 treatment. Recently, molnupiravir is a prodrug antiviral medication that was approved in the United Kingdom in November 2021 for the treatment of COVID-19. On the other hand, PF-07321332 is an oral antiviral drug developed by Pfizer. For the treatment of COVID-19, the PF-07321332/ritonavir combination medication is used in Phase III studies and was marketed as Paxlovid.

Analysis of RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2-infected MOV-treated golden hamster lung biopsies confirmed MOV's efficiency in stopping SARS-CoV-2 replication. Importantly, MOV treatment did not increase mutations in the host lung cells. This finding calls for additional mutation calls on host biopsies from more proliferative tissues to fully explore MOV's hypothesized mutagenic risk."

35132671,A computational comparative analysis of the binding mechanism of molnupiravir's active metabolite to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of wild-type and Delta subvariant AY.4 of SARS-CoV-2.,"The antiviral drug molnupiravir targets the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) enzyme. Early treatment with molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death in at-risk, unvaccinated adults with COVID-19, according to phase 3 clinical trials. Many mutations have occurred within this virus as a result of its widespread distribution. The current study sought to determine whether mutations in the RdRP of Delta subvariant AY.4 (D-AY.4 RdRP) influence the interaction of the enzyme with molnupiravir triphosphate (MTP), the active metabolite of molnupiravir. The interactions between the wild-type (WT) RdRP and D-AY.4 RdRP with MTP were evaluated based on molecular docking and dynamic simulation (MD) studies. The results show that the MTP interaction is stronger and more stable with D-AY.4 RdRP than with WT RdRP. This study provides insight into the potential significance of administering MTP to patients infected with D-AY.4 RdRP, which may have a more favorable chance of alleviating the illness. According to the findings of this study, MTP has a high likelihood of becoming widely used as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. The fact that MTP is not only cytotoxic but also mutagenic to mammalian cells, as well as the possibility that it may cause DNA damage in the host, have all been raised as potential concerns."

35279008,Drug interaction risk between cardioprotective drugs and drugs used in treatment of COVID-19: A evidence-based review from six databases.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This Review discusses the potential drug interactions risk between Drugs used in treating COVID-19 infection and Drugs used in treating comorbid conditions (Diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular illness). METHOD: Six Databases were consulted a) Micromedex drug interaction b) Medicine complete.com c) Liverpool Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies d) Epocrates e) Medscape f) drugs.com. To acquire information on possible interaction effects between drugs used for COVID-19 treatment such as atazanavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir, paxlovid(nirmatrelvir/ritonavir), dexamethasone, azithromycin, chloroquine, and FDA approved monoclonal antibodies with primarily used antidiabetic drugs, antihypertensive drugs, and drugs acting on the cardiovascular system. RESULTS: Potential interaction effects such as worsening glycemic control were prominent with lopinavir/ritonavir and the primarily used antidiabetic drugs, which needs dosage adjustment and close monitoring. The risk of hypotension and irregular heart rhythm is the potential interaction effects with concomitant use of drugs for COVID-19 treatment and antihypertensive drugs. Caution is advised with drugs such as atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir when concomitantly used in treating comorbid conditions. Drugs such as remdesivir, molnupiravir, and some monoclonal antibodies are safer in use with drugs used in treating the comorbid condition. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-drug interaction remains one of the significant factors in altering the therapeutic efficacy. Drugs used to manage comorbid conditions may influence the COVID-19 treatment with potential interaction effects. These enhance the view on safety concerns about the drug interaction risk in managing COVID-19 infection in patients with comorbid conditions. This primary evidence may concern preventing potential or unintentional effects resulting from Drug-drug interaction, Improving patient quality of life."

It could evade the protection provided by mAbs being used in clinics for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients. Booster dose is recommended to elevate the protective levels of antibodies in COVID‐19 vaccinated individuals. The development of powerful oral antiviral drugs such as Molnupiravir and Paxlovid have shown promising clinical results and raised new hopes of COVID‐19 treatment. High efforts are being made to develop highly efficacious vaccines, and by implementing appropriate prevention and control strategies to counter Omicron."
35058587,Structure genomics of SARS-CoV-2 and its Omicron variant: drug design templates for COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has brought an unprecedented public health crisis and persistently threatens to humanity. With tireless efforts from scientists around the world, understanding of the biology of coronavirus has been greatly enhanced over the past 2 years. Structural biology has demonstrated its powerful impact on uncovering structures and functions for the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and guided the development of drugs and vaccines against COVID-19. In this review, we summarize current progress in the structural biology of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss important biological issues that remain to be addressed. We present the examples of structure-based design of Pfizer's novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug PF-07321332 (Paxlovid), Merck's nucleotide inhibitor molnupiravir (Lagevrio), and VV116, an oral drug candidate for COVID-19. These examples highlight the importance of structure in drug discovery to combat COVID-19. We also discussed the recent variants of Omicron and its implication in immunity escape from existing vaccines and antibody therapies."
35186172,Human/SARS-CoV-2 genome-scale metabolic modeling to discover potential antiviral targets for COVID-19.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a substantial increase in mortality and economic and social disruption. The absence of US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highlights the need for new therapeutic drugs to combat COVID-19. METHODS: The present study proposed a fuzzy hierarchical optimization framework for identifying potential antiviral targets for COVID-19. The objectives in the decision-making problem were not only to evaluate the elimination of the virus growth, but also to minimize side effects causing treatment. The identified candidate targets could promote processes of drug discovery and development. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: Our gene-centric method revealed that dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibition could reduce viral biomass growth and metabolic deviation by 99.4% and 65.6%, respectively, and increase cell viability by 70.4%. We also identified two-target combinations that could completely block viral biomass growth and more effectively prevent metabolic deviation. We also discovered that the inhibition of two antiviral metabolites, cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and uridine-5'-triphosphate (UTP), exhibits effects similar to those of molnupiravir, which is undergoing phase III clinical trials. Our predictions also indicate that CTP and UTP inhibition blocks viral RNA replication through a similar mechanism to that of molnupiravir."

35130559,Pyrimidine inhibitors synergize with nucleoside analogues to block SARS-CoV-2.,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than 261 million people and has led to more than 5 million deaths in the past year and a half(1) ( https://www.who.org/ ). Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection typically develop mild-to-severe flu-like symptoms, whereas infection of a subset of individuals leads to severe-to-fatal clinical outcomes(2). Although vaccines have been rapidly developed to combat SARS-CoV-2, there has been a dearth of antiviral therapeutics. There is an urgent need for therapeutics, which has been amplified by the emerging threats of variants that may evade vaccines. Large-scale efforts are underway to identify antiviral drugs. Here we screened approximately 18,000 drugs for antiviral activity using live virus infection in human respiratory cells and validated 122 drugs with antiviral activity and selectivity against SARS-CoV-2. Among these candidates are 16 nucleoside analogues, the largest category of clinically used antivirals. This included the antivirals remdesivir and molnupiravir, which have been approved for use in COVID-19. RNA viruses rely on a high supply of nucleoside triphosphates from the host to efficiently replicate, and we identified a panel of host nucleoside biosynthesis inhibitors as antiviral. Moreover, we found that combining pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors with antiviral nucleoside analogues synergistically inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo against emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a clinical path forward."
35056802,Potential COVID-19 Drug Candidates Based on Diazinyl-Thiazol-Imine Moieties: Synthesis and Greener Pastures Biological Study.,"A novel series of 1-aryl-N-[4-phenyl-5-(arylazo)thiazol-2-yl)methanimines has been synthesized via the condensation of 2-amino-4-phenyl-5-arylazothiazole with various aromatic aldehydes. The synthesized imines were characterized by spectroscopic techniques, namely (1)H and (13)C-NMR, FTIR, MS, and Elemental Analysis. A molecular comparative docking study for 3a-f was calculated, with reference to two approved drugs, Molnupiravir and Remdesivir, using 7BQY (M(pro); PDB code 7BQY; resolution: 1.7 A°) under identical conditions. The binding scores against 7BQY were in the range of -7.7 to -8.7 kcal/mol for 3a-f. The high scores of the compounds indicated an enhanced binding affinity of the molecules to the receptor. This is due to the hydrophobic interactions and multi-hydrogen bonds between 3a-f ligands and the receptor's active amino acid residues. The main aim of using in silco molecular docking was to rank 3a-f with respect to the approved drugs, Molnupiravir and Remdesivir, using free energy methods as greener pastures. A further interesting comparison presented the laydown of the ligands before and after molecular docking. These results and other supporting statistical analyses suggested that ligands 3a-f deserve further investigation in the context of potential therapeutic agents for COVID-19. Free-cost, PASS, SwissADME, and Way2drug were used in this research paper to determine the possible biological activities and cytotoxicity of 3a-f."
35289434,Advances in the Omicron variant development.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 has spread worldwide, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic, on 11 March 2020. Variants of concern have appeared at regular intervals-Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and now Omicron. Omicron variant, first identified in Botswana in November 2021, is rapidly becoming the dominant circulating variant. In this review, we provide an overview regarding the molecular profile of the Omicron variant, epidemiology, transmissibility, the impact on vaccines, as well as vaccine escape, and finally, we report the pharmacological agents able to block the endocellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 or to inhibit its viral replication. The Omicron has more than 50 mutations, of which the spike protein has 26-35 amino acids different from the original SARS-CoV-2 virus or the Delta, some of which are associated with humoral immune escape potential and greater transmissibility. Omicron has a significant growth advantage over Delta, leading to rapid spread with higher incidence levels. The disease so far has been mild compared to the Delta. The two vaccination doses offer little or no protection against Omicron infection while the booster doses provide significant protection against mild illness and likely offer even greater levels of protection against serious illness. Recently, new oral antiviral agents such as molnupiravir and paxlovid have been approved and represent important therapeutic alternatives to antiviral remdesivir. In addition, monoclonal antibodies such as casirivimab/imdevimab bind different epitopes of the spike protein receptor; is this class of drugs effective against the Omicron variant? However, more research is needed to define whether Omicron is indeed more infectious and whether the vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antivirals currently available are effective."
35381167,Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of oral antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 in Korea.,"OBJECTIVES: Countries authorized the emergency use of oral antiviral agents in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of introducing these novel oral antiviral agents to reduce the number of severe patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the burden of the medical systems. METHODS: From the existing COVID-19 Epidemiology Model, we projected the number of people who require hospital/ICU admissions in Korea in 2022. Treatment scenarios included (i) all adults, (ii) elderly, and (iii) adult patients with underlying diseases administered molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir vis-a-vis standard care. Under the current health systems capacity, we calculate the incremental cost per severe patient averted and per net admission for each scenario relative to standard care. RESULTS: An estimated, 236,510 COVID-19 patients would require hospital/ICU in Korea in 2022 with standard care. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (87% efficacy) is expected to reduce the number of severe patients requiring hospital/ICU admissions by 80%, 24%, and 17% (25%, 8%, and 4% by molnupiravir with 30% efficacy) when targeting all adults, adults with underlying diseases, and elderly patients, respectively. Administration of Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may be cost-effective as $1,454, $8,878, and $8,964 (while molnupiravir may be less likely cost-effective as $7,915, $28,492, $29,575) per severe patient averted if targeted respectively to the target group mentioned above, compared to standard care. CONCLUSION: In Korea, oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 patients can be highly cost-effective if targeted to elderly patients while substantially reducing hospital admission demand below the health systems capacity limit if all adult patients are targeted compared to standard care."
35249356,An industry update: what's new in the field of therapeutic delivery?,"This Industry Update provides an overview of the some of the key events in the pharmaceutical world in December 2021. In this month Eli Lilly & Co invested heavily in drug discovery with deals with Regor Therapeutics on metabolic diseases, and Foghorn Therapeutics on cancer and other diseases caused by faults in the regulation of chromatin unpacking and repacking. Treatments for Covid-19 also feature heavily with the emergency authorization of molnupiravir and Paxlovid™ in the USA, and BiondVax's collaboration agreement with Max Planck and the University Medical Center, Göttingham on their alpaca-based single-chain antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Lastly, this month brought good news on several diseases with poor prognosis and no or limited treatment options. This included Novartis's acquisition of Gyroscope and its gene therapy for age-related macular degeneration, Merck's purchase of Chord Therapeutics and the rights of develop cladribine for generalized myasthenia gravis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, positive phase III interim results for UCB's, Bimzelx(®), in ankylosing spondylitis and AstraZeneca and Ionis co-development and commercialization deal on eplontersen for transthyretin amyloidosis."
35462919,Thymoquinone's Antiviral Effects: It is Time to be Proven in the Covid-19 Pandemic Era and its Omicron Variant Surge.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every country in the world. With more than 400 million cases and more than 5.5 million deaths. The FDA either approved or authorized the emergency use for three vaccines against COVID-19. The treatment options of COVID-19 are very limited. Multiple complementary and alternative medicine modalities were suggested to be efficacious in the treatment of COVID-19 such as Thymoquinone. The effects of Thymoquinone have been examined and multiple studies indicate a promising beneficial effect. However, the current body of research is limited in terms of its scope, quality, and quantity. While higher-quality studies are required, physicians do not routinely recommend the use of marketed supplements of natural products, including Thymoquinone for COVID-19. Given the numerous suggested positive effects of Thymoquinone, including anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, additional research is required to confirm or refute these promising benefits. Complementary and alternative medicine is an area that requires additional evidence-based practice and research to confirm effects observed in clinical practice."
35029292,Efficacy of the use of mefenamic acid combined with standard medical care vs. standard medical care alone for the treatment of COVID‑19: A randomized double‑blind placebo‑controlled trial.,"Mefenamic acid is a non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug exhibiting a wide range of anti‑inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic and probable antiviral activities. The present study evaluated the efficacy of treatment with mefenamic acid combined with standard medical care vs. standard medical care plus a placebo in ambulatory patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19; nasal/oropharyngeal swabs reverse transcription‑PCR test results positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). The present study is a phase II prospective, two‑arm, parallel‑group, randomized, double‑blind placebo‑controlled clinical trial which analyzed 36 patients. Two aspects were evaluated during the 14‑day follow‑up period: i) The time for reaching a patient acceptable symptom state (PASS), and ii) the last day of each COVID‑19 symptom presentation. Adverse effects were evaluated. The clinical severity for all the patients in the study was mild (88.9%) and moderate (11.1%). The control (placebo) group achieved PASS on day 8.0±1.3, compared with day 4.4±0.8 in the mefenamic acid group (P=0.020, Kaplan‑Meier analyses using log‑rank tests). Patients that received mefenamic acid plus standard medical care had a ~16‑fold higher probability of achieving PASS on day 8 (adjusted RR, 15.57; 95% CI, 1.22‑198.71; P=0.035), compared with the placebo plus standard medical care group. All symptoms lasted for fewer days in the mefenamic acid group, compared with the placebo group; however, only the symptoms of headache (P=0.008), retro‑orbital eye pain (P=0.049), and sore throat (P=0.029) exhibited statistically significant differences. The experimental treatment produced no severe adverse effects. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that the administration of mefenamic acid markedly reduced the symptomatology and time to reach PASS in ambulatory patients with COVID‑19. Due to its probable antiviral effects and potent anti‑inflammatory mechanisms, mefenamic acid may prove to be useful in the treatment of COVID‑19, in combination with other drugs, including the new antivirals (remdesivir, molnupiravir, or favipiravir). However, future studies are also required to confirm these findings."
35194144,Combination of antiviral drugs inhibits SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and exonuclease and demonstrates COVID-19 therapeutic potential in viral cell culture.,"SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader, which removes nucleotide inhibitors such as Remdesivir that are incorporated into the viral RNA during replication, reducing the efficacy of these drugs for treating COVID-19. Combinations of inhibitors of both the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the exonuclease could overcome this deficiency. Here we report the identification of hepatitis C virus NS5A inhibitors Pibrentasvir and Ombitasvir as SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease inhibitors. In the presence of Pibrentasvir, RNAs terminated with the active forms of the prodrugs Sofosbuvir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir and AT-527 were largely protected from excision by the exonuclease, while in the absence of Pibrentasvir, there was rapid excision. Due to its unique structure, Tenofovir-terminated RNA was highly resistant to exonuclease excision even in the absence of Pibrentasvir. Viral cell culture studies also demonstrate significant synergy using this combination strategy. This study supports the use of combination drugs that inhibit both the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and exonuclease for effective COVID-19 treatment."
35458571,Lethal Mutagenesis of RNA Viruses and Approved Drugs with Antiviral Mutagenic Activity.,"In RNA viruses, a small increase in their mutation rates can be sufficient to exceed their threshold of viability. Lethal mutagenesis is a therapeutic strategy based on the use of mutagens, driving viral populations to extinction. Extinction catastrophe can be experimentally induced by promutagenic nucleosides in cell culture models. The loss of HIV infectivity has been observed after passage in 5-hydroxydeoxycytidine or 5,6-dihydro-5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine while producing a two-fold increase in the viral mutation frequency. Among approved nucleoside analogs, experiments with polioviruses and other RNA viruses suggested that ribavirin can be mutagenic, although its mechanism of action is not clear. Favipiravir and molnupiravir exert an antiviral effect through lethal mutagenesis. Both drugs are broad-spectrum antiviral agents active against RNA viruses. Favipiravir incorporates into viral RNA, affecting the G→A and C→U transition rates. Molnupiravir (a prodrug of β-d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine) has been recently approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Its triphosphate derivative can be incorporated into viral RNA and extended by the coronavirus RNA polymerase. Incorrect base pairing and inefficient extension by the polymerase promote mutagenesis by increasing the G→A and C→U transition frequencies. Despite having remarkable antiviral action and resilience to drug resistance, carcinogenic risks and genotoxicity are important concerns limiting their extended use in antiviral therapy."
35215963,Characterization of the First SARS-CoV-2 Isolates from Aotearoa New Zealand as Part of a Rapid Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has wreaked havoc across the globe for the last two years. More than 300 million cases and over 5 million deaths later, we continue battling the first real pandemic of the 21st century. SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly, reaching most countries within the first half of 2020, and New Zealand was not an exception. Here, we describe the first isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variants during the initial virus outbreak in New Zealand. Patient-derived nasopharyngeal samples were used to inoculate Vero cells and, three to four days later, a cytopathic effect was observed in seven viral cultures. Viral growth kinetics was characterized using Vero and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. The identity of the viruses was verified by RT-qPCR, Western blot, indirect immunofluorescence assays, and electron microscopy. Whole-genome sequences were analyzed using two different yet complementary deep sequencing platforms (MiSeq/Illumina and Ion PGM™/Ion Torrent™), classifying the viruses as SARS-CoV-2 B.55, B.31, B.1, or B.1.369 based on the Pango Lineage nomenclature. All seven SARS-CoV-2 isolates were susceptible to remdesivir (EC(50) values from 0.83 to 2.42 µM) and β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (molnupiravir, EC(50) values from 0.96 to 1.15 µM) but not to favipiravir (>10 µM). Interestingly, four SARS-CoV-2 isolates, carrying the D614G substitution originally associated with increased transmissibility, were more susceptible (2.4-fold) to a commercial monoclonal antibody targeting the spike glycoprotein than the wild-type viruses. Altogether, this seminal work allowed for early access to SARS-CoV-2 isolates in New Zealand, paving the way for numerous clinical and scientific research projects in the country, including the development and validation of diagnostic assays, antiviral strategies, and a national COVID-19 vaccine development program."
35285158,RNAi to treat SARS-CoV-2-variant proofing the next generation of therapies.,"There is an urgent need to bring new antivirals to SARS-CoV-2 to the market. Indeed, in the last 3 months, we have seen at least two new antivirals approved, molnupiravir and paxlovid. Both are older established antivirals that show some efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. The work by Chang et al (2022) in the current issue of EMBO Molecular Medicine explores the use of short interfering RNAs to directly target SARS-CoV-2 and shows that RNAi is an effective approach to reducing, or even eliminating viral replication, depending on the experimental setting. This antiviral effect results in significant prevention of infection-related pathology in animals. The key feature of this approach, besides its simplicity as naked siRNAs, is that all current variants are covered by this treatment."
35364019,Availability of oral antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the requirement for an ethical prescribing approach.,"The first two oral antivirals, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, are now becoming available in many countries. These medicines will be indicated to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. These antivirals should be prescribed within 5 days of symptom onset, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection has been confirmed. However, the availability of these antivirals will be scarce for some time due to manufacturing constraints. Each country should establish a policy on the conditions under which these antivirals can be prescribed. Such a policy should be based on the fulfilment of five ethical elements: transparency, relevance, appeals, enforcement, and fairness. Following the principles of distributive justice, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir should be prescribed according to a hierarchy of predicted efficacy, ideally on the basis of an evidence-based scoring system. The placebo-controlled randomised trials that supported the temporary authorisation of these two antivirals were conducted in unvaccinated patients with COVID-19, so an evidence-based prescription practice would only use these drugs for unvaccinated patients until further data become available. However, in the countries that authorised these antivirals in 2021 (the UK and the USA), both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients meeting particular requirements have access to these antivirals. Due to the complexity of prioritisation, national health authorities should start issuing their draft policies as soon as possible and these policies should be regularly updated. The effectiveness of these antivirals against the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 must be urgently assessed. Once implemented, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir must show their effectiveness and safety in the real world, and health systems must be adequately adapted for the correct use of these antivirals."
35075452,SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike mediated immune escape and tropism shift.,"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant emerged in late 2021 and is characterised by multiple spike mutations across all spike domains. Here we show that Omicron BA.1 has higher affinity for ACE2 compared to Delta, and confers very significant evasion of therapeutic monoclonal and vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralising antibodies after two doses. mRNA vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and broadens neutralisation. Importantly, antiviral drugs remdesevir and molnupiravir retain efficacy against Omicron BA.1. We found that in human nasal epithelial 3D cultures replication was similar for both Omicron and Delta. However, in lower airway organoids, Calu-3 lung cells and gut adenocarcinoma cell lines live Omicron virus demonstrated significantly lower replication in comparison to Delta. We noted that despite presence of mutations predicted to favour spike S1/S2 cleavage, the spike protein is less efficiently cleaved in live Omicron virions compared to Delta virions. We mapped the replication differences between the variants to entry efficiency using spike pseudotyped virus (PV) entry assays. The defect for Omicron PV in specific cell types correlated with higher cellular RNA expression of TMPRSS2, and accordingly knock down of TMPRSS2 impacted Delta entry to a greater extent as compared to Omicron. Furthermore, drug inhibitors targeting specific entry pathways demonstrated that the Omicron spike inefficiently utilises the cellular protease TMPRSS2 that mediates cell entry via plasma membrane fusion. Instead, we demonstrate that Omicron spike has greater dependency on cell entry via the endocytic pathway requiring the activity of endosomal cathepsins to cleave spike. Consistent with suboptimal S1/S2 cleavage and inability to utilise TMPRSS2, syncytium formation by the Omicron spike was dramatically impaired compared to the Delta spike. Overall, Omicron appears to have gained significant evasion from neutralising antibodies whilst maintaining sensitivity to antiviral drugs targeting the polymerase. Omicron has shifted cellular tropism away from TMPRSS2 expressing cells that are enriched in cells found in the lower respiratory and GI tracts, with implications for altered pathogenesis."
35336208,Ivermectin Does Not Protect against SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the Syrian Hamster Model.,"Ivermectin, an FDA-approved antiparasitic drug, has been reported to have in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Increased off-label use of ivermectin for COVID-19 has been reported. We here assessed the effect of ivermectin in Syrian hamsters infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Beta (B.1.351) variant. Infected animals received a clinically relevant dose of ivermectin (0.4 mg/kg subcutaneously dosed) once daily for four consecutive days after which the effect was quantified. Ivermectin monotherapy did not reduce lung viral load and even significantly worsened SARS-CoV-2-induced lung pathology. Additionally, it did not potentiate the activity of molnupiravir (Lagevrio(TM)) when combined with this drug. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence that ivermectin does not result in a beneficial effect in the treatment of COVID-19. These findings are important given the increasing, dangerous off-label use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19."
35266905,"Advances in the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, clinical management and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current article reviews the latest information on the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostics, clinical management and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RECENT FINDINGS: Atypical pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 emerged in December 2019 in a market in Wuhan, China and rapidly evolved into a pandemic in March 2020. Viral loads of patients with COVID-19 peak in the first week of illness around day 2-4 and hence there is very high-transmission potential causing community outbreaks. Asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission is a hallmark of COVID-19. Several variants of concern (VOC) have emerged over the last 2 years and Omicron is the predominant variant in many countries. PCR is the standard diagnostic test while rapid antigen test is a useful supplementary test. Serology tests provide indirect evidence of infection 1-2 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir are oral antiviral agents that may reduce the risk of hospitalization and deaths if administered early to high-risk subjects. Remdesivir, baricitinib, anti-IL-6 tocilizumab and dexamethasone are frequently used for treatment of patients with respiratory failure. SUMMARY: COVID-19 pandemic progresses relentlessly with substantial morbidity and mortality especially in unvaccinated subjects. Mass COVID-19 vaccinations are the most important measure for control of the COVID-19 pandemic."
35040187,A comprehensive update on the structure and synthesis of potential drug targets for combating the coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.,"The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic COVID-19 created by its severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant, known for producing a very severe acute respiratory syndrome, has created an unprecedented situation by its continual assault around the world. The crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 variant has been a global challenge, calling to mitigate this unprecedented pandemic that has engulfed the whole world. Since the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, many researchers globally have been grappling to find new clinically trialed active drugs with anti-COVID-19 activity, from antimalarial drugs to JAK inhibitors, antiviral drugs, immune suppressants, and so forth. This article presents a brief discussion on the activity and synthesis of some active molecules such as favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, pirfenidone, remdesivir, lopinavir, camostat, chloroquine, baricitinib, molnupiravir, and so forth, which are under trial."
35145998,Structural Insights Into Tautomeric Dynamics in Nucleic Acids and in Antiviral Nucleoside Analogs.,"DNA (2'-deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) play diverse functional roles in biology and disease. Despite being comprised primarily of only four cognate nucleobases, nucleic acids can adopt complex three-dimensional structures, and RNA in particular, can catalyze biochemical reactions to regulate a wide variety of biological processes. Such chemical versatility is due in part to the phenomenon of nucleobase tautomerism, whereby the bases can adopt multiple, yet distinct isomeric forms, known as tautomers. For nucleobases, tautomers refer to structural isomers that differ from one another by the position of protons. By altering the position of protons on nucleobases, many of which play critical roles for hydrogen bonding and base pairing interactions, tautomerism has profound effects on the biochemical processes involving nucleic acids. For example, the transient formation of minor tautomers during replication could generate spontaneous mutations. These mutations could arise from the stabilization of mismatches, in the active site of polymerases, in conformations involving minor tautomers that are indistinguishable from canonical base pairs. In this review, we discuss the evidence for tautomerism in DNA, and its consequences to the fidelity of DNA replication. Also reviewed are RNA systems, such as the riboswitches and self-cleaving ribozymes, in which tautomerism plays a functional role in ligand recognition and catalysis, respectively. We also discuss tautomeric nucleoside analogs that are efficacious as antiviral drug candidates such as molnupiravir for coronaviruses and KP1212 for HIV. The antiviral efficacy of these analogs is due, in part, to their ability to exist in multiple tautomeric forms and induce mutations in the replicating viral genomes. From a technical standpoint, minor tautomers of nucleobases are challenging to identify directly because they are rare and interconvert on a fast, millisecond to nanosecond, time scale. Nevertheless, many approaches including biochemical, structural, computational and spectroscopic methods have been developed to study tautomeric dynamics in RNA and DNA systems, and in antiviral nucleoside analogs. An overview of these methods and their applications is included here."
35223088,Thermodynamic and structural insights into the repurposing of drugs that bind to SARS-CoV-2 main protease.,"Although researchers have been working tirelessly since the COVID-19 outbreak, so far only three drugs - remdesivir, ronapreve and molnupiravir - have been approved for use in some countries which directly target the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Given the slow pace and substantial costs of new drug discovery and development, together with the urgency of the matter, repurposing of existing drugs for the ongoing disease is an attractive proposition. In a recent study, a high-throughput X-ray crystallographic screen was performed for a selection of drugs which have been approved or are in clinical trials. Thirty-seven compounds have been identified from drug libraries all of which bind to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CL(pro)). In the current study, we use molecular dynamics simulation and an ensemble-based free energy approach, namely, enhanced sampling of molecular dynamics with approximation of continuum solvent (ESMACS), to investigate a subset of the aforementioned compounds. The drugs studied here are highly diverse, interacting with different binding sites and/or subsites of 3CL(pro). The predicted free energies are compared with experimental results wherever they are available and they are found to be in excellent agreement. Our study also provides detailed energetic insights into the nature of the associated drug-protein binding, in turn shedding light on the design and discovery of potential drugs."
35249180,Different compounds against Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor potentially containing the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2: an in silico study.,"Novel SARS coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that was identified and spread from Wuhan in 2019. On January 30th, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak as a Global Public Health Emergency. Although Remdesivir and Molnupiravir are FDA-approved drugs for COVID-19, finding new efficient and low-cost antiviral drugs against COVID-19 for applying in more countries can still be helpful. One of the potential sources for finding new and low-cost drugs is the herbal compounds in addition to repurposing FDA-approved drugs. So, in this study, we focused on finding effective drug candidates against COVID-19 based on the computational approaches. As ACE2 serves as a critical receptor for cell entry of this virus. Inhibiting the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 on human ACE2 provides a promising therapeutic approach for developing drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we applied a bioinformatics approach to identify possible potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. A library of FDA-approved compounds and five natural compounds was screened using Smina docking. Top-docking compounds are then applied in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to assess the stability of ACE2-inhibitor complexes. Results indicate that Luteolin and Chrysin represent high conformation stability with ACE2 during 120 ns of Molecular Dynamics simulation. The binding free energies of Luteolin and Chrysin were calculated by the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area method (MM/PBSA) which confirmed the relative binding free energy of these drugs to ACE2 in favor of the effective binding. So, Luteolin and Chrysin could sufficiently interact with ACE2 and block the Spike binding pocket of ACE2 and can be a potential inhibitor against the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptor which is an early stage of infection. Luteolin and Chrysin could be suggestive as beneficial compounds for preventing or reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection which need experimental work to prove."
35271914,Establishment of a stable SARS-CoV-2 replicon system for application in high-throughput screening.,"Experiments with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are limited by the need for biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions. A SARS-CoV-2 replicon system rather than an in vitro infection system is suitable for antiviral screening since it can be handled under BSL2 conditions and does not produce infectious particles. However, the reported replicon systems are cumbersome because of the need for transient transfection in each assay. In this study, we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome vector (the replicon-BAC vector) including the SARS-CoV-2 replicon and a fusion gene encoding Renilla luciferase and neomycin phosphotransferase II, examined the antiviral effects of several known compounds, and then established a cell line stably harboring the replicon-BAC vector. Several cell lines transiently transfected with the replicon-BAC vector produced subgenomic replicon RNAs (sgRNAs) and viral proteins, and exhibited luciferase activity. In the transient replicon system, treatment with remdesivir or interferon-β but not with camostat or favipiravir suppressed the production of viral agents and luciferase, indicating that luciferase activity corresponds to viral replication. VeroE6/Rep3, a stable replicon cell line based on VeroE6 cells, was successfully established and continuously produced viral proteins, sgRNAs and luciferase, and their production was suppressed by treatment with remdesivir or interferon-β. Molnupiravir, a novel coronavirus RdRp inhibitor, inhibited viral replication more potently in VeroE6/Rep3 cells than in VeroE6-based transient replicon cells. In summary, our stable replicon system will be a powerful tool for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals through high-throughput screening."
35352546,"Management of SARS-CoV-2 infection: recommendations of the Polish Association of Epidemiologists and Infectiologists as of February 23, 2022.","The first Polish recommendations regarding the management of patients with COVID-19 were published by the Polish Society of Epidemiologists and Infectiologists (PTEiLChZ) on March 31, 2020, and the last annex was dated November 12, 2021. The ongoing state of pandemic, the emergence of new variants of the virus, and the availability of new drugs necessitate their updating. Changes introduced in the current version of recommendations for the management of COVID-19 comprised the possibility of using remedesivir in an outpatient setting, previously reserved for inpatient treatment, as well as other antiviral drugs-molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir / ritonavir. We revised the possibility of using monoclonal antibodies due to the resistance of the currently dominant Omicron variant. Anakinra, an antagonist of interleukin 1 receptors, has been added as a treatment option in advanced stages of the disease, and the recommended daily dose of glucocorticosteroids used in the most severe forms of COVID-19 has been increased. Information on vaccination and pre-exposure prophylaxis in specific populations has also been updated."
35033572,Very low levels of remdesivir resistance in SARS-COV-2 genomes after 18 months of massive usage during the COVID19 pandemic: A GISAID exploratory analysis.,"Massive usage of antiviral compounds during a pandemic creates an ideal ground for emergence of resistant strains. Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), was extensively prescribed under emergency use authorization during the first 18 months of the COVID19 pandemic, before randomized controlled trials showed poor efficacy in hospitalized patients. RdRp mutations conferring resistance to remdesivir are well known from in vitro studies, and the huge SARS-CoV-2 sequencing effort during the ongoing COVID19 pandemic represents an unprecedented opportunity to assess emergence and fitness of antiviral resistance in vivo. We mined the GISAID database to extrapolate the frequency of remdesivir escape mutations. Our analysis reveals very low levels of remdesivir resistance worldwide despite massive usage."
35222030,Effectiveness of Antiviral Therapy in Highly-Transmissible Variants of SARS-CoV-2: A Modeling and Simulation Study.,"As of October 2021, neither established agents (e.g., hydroxychloroquine) nor experimental drugs have lived up to their initial promise as antiviral treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection. While vaccines are being globally deployed, variants of concern (VOCs) are emerging with the potential for vaccine escape. VOCs are characterized by a higher within-host transmissibility, and this may alter their susceptibility to antiviral treatment. Here we describe a model to understand the effect of changes in within-host reproduction number R(0), as proxy for transmissibility, of VOCs on the effectiveness of antiviral therapy with molnupiravir through modeling and simulation. Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801 or MK 4482) is an orally bioavailable antiviral drug inhibiting viral replication through lethal mutagenesis, ultimately leading to viral extinction. We simulated 800 mg molnupiravir treatment every 12 h for 5 days, with treatment initiated at different time points before and after infection. Modeled viral mutations range from 1.25 to 2-fold greater transmissibility than wild type, but also include putative co-adapted variants with lower transmissibility (0.75-fold). Antiviral efficacy was correlated with R(0), making highly transmissible VOCs more sensitive to antiviral therapy. Total viral load was reduced by up to 70% in highly transmissible variants compared to 30% in wild type if treatment was started in the first 1-3 days post inoculation. Less transmissible variants appear less susceptible. Our findings suggest there may be a role for pre- or post-exposure prophylactic antiviral treatment in areas with presence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, clinical trials with borderline efficacious results should consider identifying VOCs and examine their impact in post-hoc analysis."
35315683,Therapeutic treatment with an oral prodrug of the remdesivir parental nucleoside is protective against SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in mice.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains uncontrolled despite the rapid rollout of safe and effective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, underscoring the need to develop highly effective antivirals. In the setting of waning immunity from infection and vaccination, breakthrough infections are becoming increasingly common and treatment options remain limited. Additionally, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, with their potential to escape neutralization by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, emphasizes the need to develop second-generation oral antivirals targeting highly conserved viral proteins that can be rapidly deployed to outpatients. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro antiviral activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of GS-621763, an orally bioavailable prodrug of GS-441524, the parent nucleoside of remdesivir, which targets the highly conserved virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. GS-621763 exhibited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in lung cell lines and two different human primary lung cell culture systems. GS-621763 was also potently antiviral against a genetically unrelated emerging coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). The dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile observed after oral administration of GS-621763 translated to dose-dependent antiviral activity in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic GS-621763 administration reduced viral load and lung pathology; treatment also improved pulmonary function in COVID-19 mouse model. A direct comparison of GS-621763 with molnupiravir, an oral nucleoside analog antiviral which has recently received EUA approval, proved both drugs to be similarly efficacious in mice. These data support the exploration of GS-441524 oral prodrugs for the treatment of COVID-19."
